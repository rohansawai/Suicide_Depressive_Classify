"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,180,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/
"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

---

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at /r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

* People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See /r/depression/wiki/private_contact
* ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.
* Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.
* Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10). 
* Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",circinia,186,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tc5fpx/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/

(TW: self harm) I thought I had overcome self harm - but it has just manifested in a different form,"Just want to preface this by saying that this is fucked up, and I know it. Read it if you want to.


TW: Self harm. Please dont proceed if you struggle with it.


I (18f) used to self harm in the traditional sense of the word. You know, cut my wrists and thighs. It was really a euphoric feeling, watching the blood pour out, the sting, but the pleasure at the same time. Feeling the tightness in your chest loosening with each cut. 


I decided to quit cutting, because I didnt want scars all over my body forever. And I succeeded. Haven’t cut myself in about 4 years now. I thought I had overcome self harm. But I dont think I actually have.


After I stopped cutting, I resorted to binge eating. I gained about 40 pounds - and as a teenager that really fucked me up. I loved the feeling of being bloated, and knowing it was hurting my body only made it better. The pain of binging was strangely satisying. At the time, I didn’t realise it was self harm, but looking back, it’s obvious. 


I stopped keeping my room tidy, started mildly rejecting personal hygiene (not to extreme levels, but still), started smoking cigarettes, drinking, watching porn, not taking care of my skin, not sleeping enough etc. etc.


You may say that these are typical symptoms of depression, and you’d probably be right. But at least part of the reason I started doing this, was because I knew it was hurting my body and soul. I knew having a dirty room was bad for me, so I did it. I knew smoking was terrible for me, so i started smoking. I knew watching porn made me feel like shit, so I kept watching it. I knew not keeping up with skincare was bad for me, so I stopped taking care of my skin. 


I got the same kind of fucked up pleasure from hurting myself like this. I liked looking in the mirror and seeing a sleep deprived, bloated, dirty teenager that reeked of smoke. I liked seeing my room as dirty as it was. I knew all of this shit was hurting me, and I liked it.


I didn’t realise all of this at the time, but I’ve been doing some reflection recently and realised that this is what I’ve been doing. I know I’m fucked in the head, and I am currently getting help, but I just wanted to share this, in case I could help any of you realise that you’re also doing this. 


If you made it this far, thanks for reading.",siouxsie18,44,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuqey3/tw_self_harm_i_thought_i_had_overcome_self_harm/
[16F] - I was molested by my uncle when I was 14 and now i'm depressed (T/W),"**TRIGGER WARNING**

I feel super broken and depressed right now so I'm posting this to try and get some things off my chest.

I'm a 16 year old girl and I was raped/molested by my uncle from the age of 14-15. Nobody knew he was doing this to me. My family all loved him, all his friends thought he was great but behind closed doors he was a complete monster to me and he's ruined my life.

My parents often have to travel abroad for their work so they asked my uncle to look after me until they got back. It was always fine at first and normal, he would cook me food, clean up, make sure I was ready for school each day etc.

However he started to get creepy pretty quickly, he would always ask me for hugs which I thought was normal as he's my uncle but he started to hug me really tight and sort of grope my bum/body as he did it and it would make me uncomfortable but I thought he was just doing it by accident.

Then he would start asking me to kiss him on the cheek before I left for school because he wanted me to have a great day and he would miss me... again I thought this was kinda weird but I've kissed family members on the cheek before so I didn't think too much of it but then he started asking me to kiss him on the lips and that's when I started to feel trapped. I am such a stupid girl but I didn't dare tell my parents what was going on, I thought they wouldn't believe me or they would say ""oh he doesn't mean anything bad with this, it's just the older generation being friendly"" etc

**T/W** \- After school at night he would start coming into my room to ""watch movies"" with me, he would join me in my bed and I would just freeze. I don't know why I didn't hit him or push him away but he would start hugging me and start touching my body, pulling down my skirt/leggings, saying how beautiful I was. He would do *things* to me and I would have to do *things* to him. I wouldn't say a word I would zone out and just let it happen, sometimes I would cry but he wouldn't care or stop. He said if I told anyone he would hurt me/my family and everyone will think I'm a slut at school if they found out. This was enough of a threat for me not to tell anyone for almost 2 years.

I would dread my parents having to go away for work, I would beg them not to go but I didn't dare tell them why. I was so stupid and naive, I could have solved all of this by just speaking out.

In the end I was so broken I told one of my friends what was going on and they then told my school/parents and he ended up getting arrested and sent to jail. But he's left behind a broken, depressed girl who has no idea how she will get through life. I am seeing a therapist but it doesn't feel like anything is really working...

So yeah... I don't know who will care enough to read all of this but I'm desperate for help and I feel so broken.",LauraQuiroga,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tv9u6v/16f_i_was_molested_by_my_uncle_when_i_was_14_and/
Does depression ever go away? I’m tired of feeling like this.,"I’m trying. I’m trying really hard but I just feel empty. I’m trying to be proactive to solve these issues but I feel so deeply stressed.

- For sexual abuse trauma, raised by narcissistic parents, ending an abusive relationship 1.5 months ago etc.,: I’m in therapy x2 a week. 
- For feeling ugly after being cheated on, wanting to boost my self confidence: I got myself a PT.
- For being so lonely and not having friends: I got Bumble BFF.
- For feeling like my life has no purpose: I’ve thrown myself into work.
- For feeling bored out my mind: I started booking solo travels, took up volunteering and learning a new language.

Etc. I just don’t know what to do. I feel lonely. I want to be in love, have kids, own a home, save money, buy a dog, make jam… I’m 29F and I feel like time is running out. Running out because the abuse from my last relationship was pretty traumatic and it’s going to take me awhile to get myself together. To be mentally strong for a relationship.

Long Term Exit Plan (in 1 year),"**In short:**

My life went to hell during the pandemic and I lost my job, partner, house, savings, and had to move back in with my family.

I actually didnt get depressed right away - I got a job and saved 4k - and then the depression hit and I just stayed in bed for a month and dreamed of ending it all.

Recently I made mental health gains and am a little more functional but still not well enough to hold down a job or socialise well.

Also, every plan I make to move back abroad and start up a new life keeps falling though. Its this weird stretch of bad luck that isnt changing.

**My Plan:**

Squeeze more out of life. I know there is beauty in this world sometimes.

I also want to do more good things - help a farm, an orphanage, cook food for the vulnerable.

So the plan is to go to south america and volunteer and give back. Maybe teach English a little. Perhaps work for good causes in exchange for a bed to sleep in.

After 6 months of giving back the plan is to jump off a nice tall building or mountain.

Thats it. And it wont be selfish as I gave back to the world for 6 months before exiting.",wordsandmagic,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tv6xpv/long_term_exit_plan_in_1_year/
do things actually “get better”?,"it just feels like i’ve been struggling with this for forever.

i remember the first day i realized i was alone. eating at lunch around faceless people longing for some kind of connection. i remember the nights crying dreading school because of the seemingly endless cycle of loneliness

but for some reason, i still endured.

i remember the companionship some people finally showed me. how much i cherished finally being around people i could talk to daily. i remember the falling out, and how as everyone shifted to their own circles i was seemingly only left behind. i was back to square one

but for some reason, i still endured. 

i remember when i first noticed the signs of this cycle restarting. how i wished each time it would be different. but it wasn’t. and i was only back to square one again

i was always the seemingly common denominator in all these events. if i’m always left behind, always back in square one,  what’s the point of this blind optimism?
i’ve already lost so much of myself
what’s the point of enduring any more just because i keep lying to myself that things get better?

I'm starting to isolate myself again,"I've had a habit, I want to say over the past 2-3 years of getting a really nice friend group who I get along with really well and who care about me until I feel like I do one thing wrong or I annoy them in one way or another until I decide to cut them all off, stop speaking to them and I've even done it to the point that I've been left for long periods at a time without any close friends at all.

That being said, I'm currently in my first year of college and I've already done this twice (in my first semester) and for the first time, I feel like I've made a group of friends who I really do like as people and who I know really care about me and all I can think about is how I'm already starting to isolate myself from them. It's happened with all my in person relationships (weirdly enough, I find online friendships less intense and much easier to maintain) and at this moment I don't want to lose the friends I have but I still feel bad for starting to isolate myself already.

I haven't done anything to deeply agitate them, there's been the occasional side-eye between me and other people in the group but nothing to suggest that we still don't all really get along. I've stopped going out on night's out or on activities because I feel like shit and I feel guilty then if I'm not in a good mood because I feel like I'll ruin their time. My worry is that even though one person in the group has asked me if I'm okay or why I'm not my usual self, that they'll eventually get used to not having me around which I feel is what I subconsciously want because it means that I finally won't be making them worry, but if they do get used to not having me around, it'll mean I'm back to square one of making a new set of friends, feeling shit, making them feel shit until eventually they forget about me.

I feel like I just come across as manipulative and not a real friend. But I feel that by sticking around, I'm just a burden and a very intense person to be around. I make rash decisions, I'm not very mature and I lack a lot of basic social skills. Could there have been something growing up to cause this? Was I born this way? Part of me just wants to not interact with people in person seeing as I feel like I'm constantly letting people down and as much as I don't want to let the current people in my life down, I feel like me isolating myself is inevitable because I don't know how to keep friends any other way.",antaineme,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tv9xys/im_starting_to_isolate_myself_again/

I have no motivation live anymore I think?,"I have always dealt with this constant fatigue and brain fog. Ever since I was young I just remember always wanting to be in my bed or just sitting doing nothing. I noticed this more once I hit middle school and noticed it progressed and worsened in high school. To the point in college where I hardly left the house and rarely do now.

I’ve lost a good amount of friends because of this. I just have no energy to get up and do anything. There was a brief period in college before I started nursing school where I worked out 4-6x a week and ate relatively healthy. But I did indulge in binging and purging episodes to help myself lose about 10-15lbs. But in the back of mind I was miserable because I knew I was forcing myself to exercise, count my calories, and if I ate over a certain amount of cal I’d force myself to throw up and not eat. After starting nursing school I had no time to work out and felt so relieved. Since that mean I could finally rest and lay in bed and just watch tv. 
 
I’m just tired of life and living I really don’t see the point of it. If at the end of the day no matter how rich or poor you are, what you do or don’t accomplish you’re still going to die. These feelings and thoughts have really exacerbated since graduating and becoming a nurse. I recently just quit my nursing job of 1.5years with no backup because I couldn’t do it anymore. I felt I was in a loop in life all I did was wake up, go to work, come home, and sleep. I just felt like I was constantly in fight &amp; flight mode and never felt rested. I worked Night Shift and would catch myself sleeping 12-16 hours sometimes even 18hrs-20 depending on my week. But even after sleeping for that long I am still tired!! I would just sleep some more or stay in bed until I finally couldn’t take it anymore and had to get up to either eat or use the restroom.  

Along with this, I don’t think there is ever a night where I could just go to sleep. I stay up thinking about everything going on in life and how it hasn’t worked out in the way I thought it would. Or just thinking why am I not happy? I am filled with what I think is anxiety because I don’t know what’s next. I don’t want to work anymore I hate my job as a nurse and don’t want to go back to nursing. I am usually up till around 5-10am with these thoughts crying and panicking. Then I usually tire myself out go to sleep and don’t wake up til 5-9 pm and start my day and do it all over again. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I am not sure if what I am dealing with is mental health issues or not. I’ve tired to go to my parents for help but they don’t think anything is wrong. I’m just lost and I don’t really know what to do anymore and I’ve given up. I want to try therapy but can’t bring myself to do it.

I got her out of a very abusive(mentally, not physically) relationship and just 2 months later she starts having sympoms of depression like being uninterested in anything and not caring at all ect. Ever since we realised there's a problem she started going to the psychiatrist and he said she's probably got multiple issues. Anyway, to get to my point, this weekend she snorted speed and the day later took MDMA because she said that's the only way she'll feel something.

Even when I meet new people and exchange with them I don't feel satisfied in my need to feel connected to someone. So no matter what I try, I feel empty and lonely.

Accepting you have depression?,"Hi all. 

I’m not even sure where to start, but I’ll try to keep it short. 

For the most part - at least, so it seems - I am a pretty content person. Every now and again, like maybe once or twice a year, I’ll have a depressive bout that lasts about a day or two. It’s usually something I can sleep off and feel back to my usual self. 

Lately, and for the past month, month and a half, I’ve been struggling with these bouts. They come and go in waves and I’m really not used to it being this prolonged. 

There’s nothing happening either that I feel would trigger it; at least, not anything past my usual stressors.

Just really tired of how life works in general.,"Is anyone simply tired of how life works? By that I mean the only thing that is permanent is... impermanence.
Nothing ever stays the same, everything has a beginning and an end, and I know it's how life keeps evolving. But wouldn't it be a little comforting knowing at lest one or two important aspects of our lives simply are there to stay?
I am firm believer relationships are the most important thing we all have in life: love, friendships, family and so on, impact our perception of life much deeper than anything else.
And even those are bound to change and quite possibly end. And it makes me furious, frustrated, and sad.
We all have to go through so much on day to day basis, expectations, responsabilities, careers, dreams, projects, etc. I wish there was some kind of certainty at least in relationships, especilly romantic ones. That kind of stability, that mutual desire to keep working on something that mtters more than anything else, is there anyone left in this fast-everything world that is really willing to commit?
Riding the wave of change is a skill that can only lead everyone to great things and huge evolution, but does anyone feel like there's also the need for stability, to know for certain that someone is there no mtter what?

I am suicidal but I don't identify being mentally ill because my reason for wanting to take my life is not because I am depressed. I want to end myself as soon as possible but I don’t want my loves ones hurt. Help.,"Hey, I'm a 3rd year college student, 21, she/her and I don't really identify with having a mental illness but I guess that's quite the contrary since people who are suicidal are associated with having a disorder. I am taking anti-depressants, though. My parents and my partner knows about my idealizations because I had several attempts of un-aliving myself and I was taken to the hospital where I had to stay for days to recover. It was their idea to put me on medications. Anyway, I don't think I'm ill because my reason for wanting to take my life isn't because I hate my life or because of something traumatic. I live in a cozy house, I am financially supported, I am loved by my family, peers and my partner is really great and supports me in everything except my “harmful” idealizations, of course.

*I'm just not interested in experiencing life. I’ve been thinking that wanting to live is overrated for a very long time but I don’t blame people who want to live because our civilized world breeds people that way or it’s just natural instinct to not want to harm ourselves. I think those who are passionate about life are interesting and I respect their desire for something, I just think it’s not for me and I have validated myself for not wanting that for a long time. I often imagine having a “successful” life but I still don’t want to experience that. I enjoy making art sometimes but my creativity doesn’t excite me as much as leaving this world does. I just don’t find anything about life appealing nor do I want anything from it.*

I realized that I didn’t want to continue living anymore from an early age, probably in middle school when I learned that people can choose to stop living. I wasn’t stressed by school or anything at that time, I just didn’t understand the fascination and commitment most people have in living. This idealization went on until I reached high school and it was painful that this was the time I learned that being suicidal was seen as a disorder and I became alarmed that I did my research. At some point, I was confident that I was suffering from “depression” and years went on until I reached that moment where my whole family was very alarmed with my urges and how I’d actually do it. There were times I failed,  times I backed out, and times I almost succeeded but someone finding my dying body. The worst one was when my 6-year-old sister found me lying in the floor when I overdosed. It’s funny to me how I just really suck at killing myself.

When I turned 20, my parents decided that I should stay with my partner’s place because they thought that me having a companion 24/7 would greatly help in keeping me alive. It’s great and all, like living with my best friend but mentally, things stayed the same for me or probably worse because now someone I really love has to see me like this and I have to see him hurting because of me. I feel bad whenever I have/plan an attempt because then he finds out about it at some point even when I try to hide it. This is when I started to have strong doubts because even if I really wanted to die and I am so sure of it, I’ll be leaving people who love me with the trauma of losing someone to suicide, and that’s including my cats. They won’t mourn the same way that humans will, but that’s beside the point. This is honestly the only reason why I have doubts whether I should end my life because I don’t want to inflict trauma onto my loved ones when I leave.

I have been thinking about this carefully planned out attempt for quite a while where I do it in a hotel room, I never actually tried to do it away from home where I’m alone and maybe that’s also another reason why I keep failing. I’m pretty keen that this one will succeed but before I pull it off, I guess I want some rational thoughts and advice from others that have similar experiences/ people with suicidal loved ones/ ones that lost someone from it. I am 99% sure that I want to end my life as soon as I can but the 1% is this lingering concern of what do I do with the loved ones that I leave behind? I don’t believe in religion or anything beyond the physical realm. I am more so leaning on the idea that if people die it’s just like sleeping forever without dreaming and I won’t be witnessing and feeling any of their pain but right now, I am able to feel empathy and it hurts to leave them with a really deep scar. But also every day is suffering for me. It’s like this analogy of wanting to choose a course in university that I am really passionate about but my parents not approving of it so I decide to study a course that I hate for years but the only difference is that, it’s not just a couple of years. Life goes on until we die. Every day is honestly painful for me because I did not even consent to live and I haven’t found anything here that makes me want to stay. That along with people wanting me to live. Waking up feels like a drag. Everything does. Any thoughts?

How are some of y’all in relationships?,"I see some of y’all mf’s out here on this sub talking about your boyfriend or girlfriend. Sometimes it’s even the mentally-well SO on here asking how to help their depressed partner. So how did that happen?

In case this is just a “me thing” and I look like a crazy person, I’ll include context. Friendships looks to me to be a prerequisite for any romantic relationship. Being depressed, socially anxious, or mentally unwell in other ways severely enough seems to disqualify one from friendship. For example, I’m too anxious to talk to anyone so the only way I’d make a friend is if somebody came up to me and dug through my awkwardness to find something they liked for some reason. But if they dug far enough, they’d realize that I’m just a depressed sack of shit and can’t really offer them anything. So there’s no real way for me to make a friend. And consequently, no way for me to ever be loved, either.

My only guesses are either that you aren’t bad enough to be disqualified entirely from friendship, or that you were in a relationship before you got that bad and your SO already loved you enough to stay with you. But if I’m wrong about that and there is actually a way for sad/scared af people to be loved, please let me know. Cuz never having been loved is basically all that’s wrong with me, or at least it’s all that started this whole shit parade.

I don't know what to do anymore. I need help.,"It's gonna be a long text, so bear with me. I'm 27 (m), when i was 10 my father died in a car crash. After that i was in a therapy for a while, because i was scared to be home alone (at that time i had to go to school afternoon,so i was home alone when i woke up), i was scared that my dad would come back home,idk why it fucked my like that,but it was what it was. At that time i didn't though it fucked my mind,but when i was growing up i started to see,that my mental health wasn't normal. I did things that have serious consequences, but i didnt care. I didnt care that i can die or how other will feel. At school i was bullied,because i was a lame,shy and not intresting. At my teenage years,i started to smoke,drink and do whatever. I was fighting with my mom constantly and im feel so sorry for her,for what i did at that time. Through out years i had couple serious realationships,but non of them lasted more than 1 or 1,5 years. I'm very emotional person, so every break up was so so hard for me. Fast forward,when i was about 21 i started feeling some sympthoms,like hearth ache,hard to breathe,my thoughs was getting more fucked up and darker. Couple of times i though that i was dying,having a stroke or something, even went to emergency,but everything was normal. Then i found my love of my life,went to army (had to,didn't want to and it was horrible. Im just not that kind of a person to be there) and after i was done with it i decided to go to psichiatric (before i did almost every single test on my health and every single one was fine) because my health was getting worse. So i got diagnosed with depression,anxiety and neurovegetative system disorder. I got meds that helped me for about one year. I felt normal again,i was happy. But then everything started to fall apart. From 21 till now 27,i changed, i dont even know how many meds and not a single one helped me. I changed a lot of jobs (on top of that i have really shit back,so i cant just work whatever,pain so times so bad,that i eat painkillers like candys). Been strungling financialy,changed 3 rental apartments,2 citys. I started to drink heavily,just to get my mind out of this life for a couple hours. Started to didnt care of my hygien. Ate way less,that before. Smoke much more than before. Nothing makes me happy anymore,i dont want to do anything,even lay in bed or sleep,i just want to be gone. One single thing that i can do that isnt a pain for is to game with my friend,but it doesnt last long,i get bored of game after couple days and thats it. And now i'm here. After 5 years,my gf had enough of me. My alchoholism,no financial support,me not careing about future,my suicidal though,my depression and everything. I understand her and i know that she would be much much happier without me,i'm just a negative leech in her life. But im here,just because of her,if its not her,ill probably been long gone now. And now i have nothing left. Last year was hardest for me,so i was even more in my void,than ever. I have couple of friends,but they don't uderstand what im going through and dont know how to help me. I cant go back to my parents,theres almost no jobs in that city,if i go back there i dont know how i gonna get out of there,even thinking about going back makes me more depressed. I think if i get back there i'll probalby just end it faster than being anywhere else. I have to leave where i live now,but i dont have where to go. I was thinking about suicide almost everyday since first meds stoped working and i think that time finally came. I'm scared,i dont want to end my life because of my mom and my brother and dont know a way that is not painfull if there even is any,so probably just gonna fuck myself and live rest of my life like a vegetable. And im scared to even fucking do it,im a coward,but i just dont know what to do anymore,where to go and how even fucking exist in this so called ""life"". I just want to be gone,like i was never been here. Dont feel anything,dont hear anything,dont see anything.

P.s I'm really sorry for a text wall, i don't really know how to express myself,my minds. I tried,but i probably didn't say everything or say it very poorly.

I hate that my family knows I'm depressed now,"TW: self harm, drug/alcohol abuse

           My (f15) family life has always been pretty good, both my parents work a lot so I gained freedom to do some things that others my age probably couldn't, but they were still nice and supportive parents. About a year or two ago I started experimenting with some recreational drugs, it was the usual rabbit hole; nutmeg, alcohol and benadryl, and at the time I was cutting and burning myself pretty regularly. I was able to hide it pretty well, my family had no idea and my grades were pretty alright, but the guilt got to me and I stopped everything for about a year.

           Fast forward to a couple months ago, I found some friends that were a bit older than me and we often hung out and drank together. This was a bit of a gateway as I started doing nutmeg again (Jesus its so embarrassing to write that shit), and then benadryl and one of my friends gave me adderall just for school assignments and such. My friends are pretty good people and they didn't condone me doing benadryl, but I still did it on my own. It started out with 8 capsules but it slowly built until I was taking 12 capsules every few days and was high or hungover most of the time. A week ago I took 24 capsules and went a bit insane for a couple days, I barely remember anything from the time but my parents told me I was rummaging through their drawers at 6 am and talking to myself. I started hallucinating so bad that I though my uncle died and I kept seeing people who weren't there. It got worse when I went to school and I wasn't sure if the people that were talking to me were real or not so I stopped talking. I had a math test the next day and since I couldn't read anything on the page I fucked up and got a 30. My math teacher contacted the guidance counselor since I fell asleep midway through the test and I had to go to a meeting the next day.

           I walked into the meeting prepared to keep my mouth shut about everything, but it all ended up spilling out, a part of myself knew that I didn't want to fall down a hole of drug addiction and it was better to just get help now, but I hate myself for how much I confessed. When they had to take to my blood pressure because of the benadryl they saw my recent cutting and immediately contacted my parents. They recommended some adolescent treatment facilities, and I had to talk with a psychiatrist to get a full evaluation, she kept talking about how young I am and how it's too early to be ruining my life, which mad me feel like shit.

           Anyways i'm starting tomorrow, which feels good since I can get meds and hopefully be a bit more normal from now on. But it feels like everything in my life changed so suddenly, I have no idea how I'm going to keep up with school when I'm going to be gone for so long. We had a huge trip to Italy planned for spring break and I have no idea if the treatments center will allow a break in the program. Worst of all,  my parents are being super overprotective which I understand, but they wont even let me lock my door or sleep alone. I'm an introvert and value time alone and I feel like I can't think with the constant attention. They cleanest my room (which I understand was a shithole) but it felt like a huge breech of privacy, and my mom went on a huge rant about how she feels like they've been neglecting me and she cant understand the line between freedom and neglect anymore after seeing the state of my room.

           I understand how shallow my complaints are but it feels like my whole life is changing way too fast, and I don't know when it's going to go back to normal. I'm so happy my parents didn't get angry at me for the things I did but were instead supportive but I just hate that they know so much about me now. If you managed to make it this far thank you for listening to me complain and im sorry about the shit grammar but if you had similar experiences I hope it got better for you.",beefjerkyshit,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tvb9v7/i_hate_that_my_family_knows_im_depressed_now/
In the quest for happiness,"I had and have a great life imo (good friends and family, a great job, money, etc) but I can't manage to find something that brings me happiness anymore.

I tried a lot of new stuff those past few years (in sports, trip, hobbies, etc) but nothing was able to bring me joy.

The days where I'm not feeling bored are the ones I spend with people I like, but it still doesn't really makes me happy. It's hard to explain but I'm glad to share a time with them when they are happy, it feels like I did/took part in something useful, but I don't have any more feeling than that.

I feel like I already did everything I wanted to do in life (I went where I wanted to go, did what I wanted to try, got intimate with people I wanted to get closer with, etc). And now I'm stuck.

It's not sadness, but boredom.

The issue is that even if I don't get the happy shots from life, I still get the sad bits of every day life, the things that you don't want to do or that makes your life harder. 

There is only a few stuff I want to check on my list, but after that I don't really know what I would do, I already planned everything for the worst case scenario, if I don't find something worth staying on the road.

I know it's very different from a lot of post here, and it seems like a spoiled kid issue in comparison with some,  but I was wondering if some of you ever experienced something like this and how you got out ?",Pezsteak,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tvb615/in_the_quest_for_happiness/

Trouble communicating depression to friends and venting.,"Hi, long time reader first time writing in.

**TLDR**: I am depressed and anhedonic , what is the right way to communicate that to others?  
I think I'm boring people away.  
I am also leaving my hometown for 5 months so I am afraid of losing them.

Venting time.

I'm a 26 year old man, single and unemployed for a good chunks of time due to a combination of recovering from surgery and the pandemic.  
I found seasonal work and I'm leaving my city for 5 months at the end of April. 

I think leaving home will be good for me as I will return with a significant amount of money and it's an interesting choice in general but instead of feeling some sort of relief after looking for work I totally crashed and didn't live the house for 10 days. I think I burned out in February after going to 13 interviews that month.  
My therapist thinks I might also have ADHD. It makes perfect sense to me as well.  
I am not medicated yet.

I live with my parents (as most people my age do in my country due to the economy) and I don't have a good relationship with them. Not extremely turbulent but throughout my life I could never confide to them. I'm avoidant.

I feel bitter towards family and my brother cause they used me.  
I was working in the family business for 3 years. Was not respected and not payed for my labour.  
Got out in October and had to have a hernia surgery.

I self medicate with alcohol. Basically I just listen to hours of music while I play out conversations and scenarios in my head and walk around the house.

I've dealt with mental health issues before.  
Especially in lock down, but managed to take some great steps and all in all I'd like to say I have a stronger head between my shoulders cause of it.

I've quit booze and exercised, I was learning how to code, I was playing music and I wasn't such a fucking zero when I was out with my friends.  
Now I just can't.  
I've quit studying, I eat like a bison, I drink and I don't even do things I like. Can't pay attention to movies, can't motivate myself to leave the house, I start hating playing guitar.  
Yesterday I went to a concert alone, so I'm trying. But it's brutal.  
I have nothing to say to my friends, I just hear about their lives and I'm fighting the urge to be bitter.  
I really shouldn't be dating anyone but sexual inactivity is fucking with my brain.

Well it's not like I have a choice or turning people away. But yeah.  
I don't really know how to talk to people about this stuff.

When I'm in groups of people I just zone out. I have no interest in whats happening.  
How am i supposed to meet new people in this mental state?

I'm at the prime of my life and I'm wasting it. Help.",faux_twenty,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tvb4ga/trouble_communicating_depression_to_friends_and/
"My depression leaves discipline mostly intact, but decimates motivation.","Causes of my depression are lifetime loneliness and low self-esteem. When you are forced to exist with the grim reality of having never ever experienced any romantic nor sexual attention from the opposite sex, and started learning how to live a life only at 27/28 (I was a functional child before that), even maintaining the basics like holding an analyst job and paying your mortgage consume most of your energy. 

When it is going better, I still have enough motivation left for sport, maybe slowly trying a new hobby, attempting a new activity a little. Sometimes I even get some enjoyment out of it. But during depressives episodes my energy drops. I do bare minimum at my job only to not get fired. Any other activity during that time is only done because I literally discipline myself to do it. 

Even during an episode I may wake up at 05:45 to go to the gym and start deadlifting at 06:00 - it's a 10 min bike ride that I have done even during a snowstorm in January. But very quickly I realize how pointless it is. I will push extra hard to deadlift 3x my bodyweight for 3 reps, to get it to 5 reps - but what for? It is only a number, no one cares about it, when I am down it means nothing even to me. With no motivation there is no reason, and with no reason any such effort is pointless suffering. So why bother, when you can have sweet dopamine from the Internet and binge eating instead?

It may go against the common advice that discipline is more important than motivation, but I wanted to give you an example that without motivation discipline is pointless.",Ohnoes_in_distress,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tvb4eg/my_depression_leaves_discipline_mostly_intact_but/

I remember having a panic attack in the hospital room begging myself to not let myself die. That’s when i realized i did not want to die, at least not that way. 

But the thought of dying and finally resting still excites me. It excites me the same way when i get concert tickets to my favorite band and waiting up until the show. Something about it just sounds peaceful to me. I wish death didn’t excite me this much, but i really don’t know. I guess i’m going to keep distracting myself with school work until i figure it out.

Burnout,"I am a postgrad student and have been burned out for a while now. I have multiple assignments coming up and exams soon after; that I am not prepared for in the slightest. 

I know burnout is common amongst students, but it doesn't help that I haven't made any friends on my course so it's hard to share my struggles with others. I am also certain that I might have ADHD and getting a diagnosis as an adult is a long and difficult process so I will probably have to suffer like this until I finish my degree. 

Then there is the *simple* task of finding a job and starting my career. If I knew it would be this tough I wouldn't have spent my childhood hoping to become an adult as quickly as possible. I hate how we have to do so much to prove ourselves and then we're told it's still not enough. ""Why didn't you do an internship"", ""you should have chosen a different degree"", ""you need to learn more skills"", ""you don't have enough experience"". Maybe I'm slightly bitter because I recently had an interview and was told they wanted someone with more experience, but I was a great candidate otherwise, *sigh*.

At this point I'm so exhausted that I sleep for most of the day. If I don't force myself out of bed I can easily sleep for 12 hours straight. I keep telling myself things will get better soon and there's only a few more hurdles, but I'm hanging on by a thread at this point.

I'm in therapy and I'm not convinced,"This is my first week in therapy and I feel even more depressed then before. I have some activities from monday to friday and most of the time I have nothing to do. 


Because of a previous drug addiction, my insurance only pays an addiction therapy so every group meeting until now is about craving. I overcame my addiction on my own and have been ""clean"" for a longer period. I slipped up a few times but it didn't cover my depression anymore. 


I had an appointment with the doctor on friday for 50 minutes to talk about my situation and a few tests. There is only a 25 minute appointment next friday and some group meetings. 


My depression has gone mad since I arrived here. I started with fitness and it feels really good, when I do sport with others I feel good (until my mood plummets for no particular reason) but in the evening I feel miserable. 


I lie in bed and don't want to do anything, looking at the ceiling with an empty head thinking about something I'd like to do. Everything feels useless, nothing is fun. I can force myself to watch an episode of an anime but doing anything more active seems nearly impossible.

I think about asking for an antidepressant but in the past they just made it worse because of all the side effects until they should help. i just can't stand them. 


Everyday I just want one thing: That the day is over and I'm tired and I can finally sleep. But I just sleep for a few hours everyday, every day starts at 6AM and ends with my trying to sleep without being tired.

In conflict with myself. Am I in denial?,"Everyday is a struggle. From the point of waking up to going back to sleep at night.

After being severely depressed and self harming in 2019/20, I pulled myself out of depression and started to get much better. However much more lately, things have been hitting a low. I’m not connected with friends, family or people in general and I have a job which doesn’t make me happy. I just find myself not fitting in. Not to say I’m socially awkward or uncomfortable but instead, unable to find happiness and content in doing things.

The real dilemma comes from me speaking and reassuring myself that there’s nothing wrong with me and that I’m perfectly okay. To only find myself thinking and feeling things are getting bad again. It gets to a point where I have deep and dark thoughts about suicide. I often have this obnoxious feeling of resentment and discontent. However I still live through these redundant days.

I feel so cornered,"I have been on psychiatric meds for three years now. And the list of side effects has only gotten bigger with every new one. I don’t want to be on any meds. I quit taking my most current one because I don’t like it. I didn’t just quit cold turkey, it was a gradual thing and I have to quit it and stay off meds for a bit before being introduced to a new one. And the whole system is such utter bullshit. The withdrawal symptoms are really fucking me over, except its not emotionally or mentally. The symptoms are physical. The worst one is the constant ringing in my ears and these weird zaps in my brain. The ringing is so damn loud it makes me dizzy and nauseous. I want to do so many things. I want to spend time with my family. I want to have meaningful moments with my husband. But all I have are apologies for not being able to even make it out of bed. This is no life. My family deserve better. My husband deserves so much better. I deserve better. I’m scared to try any new medications. Every time I move to a new one, the side effects are more and stronger. I don’t want to have constant headaches. I am trying so so hard and I feel so cornered. I have to take the meds to feel better but they make me worse but I can’t not take them because that is also bad.

I have few questions about anti-depressants,"I’ve been struggling with depression for months now. I’ve been going to therapy, my therapist has given me suggestions to try and get out of this rut. I’ve made new friends, left a toxic relationship, and have tried going and doing new things. None of these things work(ed). But I still feel depressed.

My therapist said that it could be chemical imbalance and that I should look into anti-depressants. I’ve scratched a little bit of the surface. I feel hesitant to ask and get a script for a couple of reasons. One being and I’m embarrassed to share it but I kinda just be “normal” and wake up and not need a medication. I do quite a bit of drugs recreationally and generally have good self discipline when doing them. But with prescription it feels like I would rely on it to exist. Secondly this is also a little embarrassing and ironic( that I’m asking Reddit) but I’m little skeptical because people label it “Chemical imbalance theory”. (Side bar) Keep in mind I’m new to this idea and I’m not trying to debunk anything just looking for some clarity. Back to my point since it is just a theory and I hope this not the case but seems like a Big Pharma shill. Ik this was bigger issue years ago but it’s still issue. Anyway I hope some of you could give me some insight and much appreciated  personal expirences.

Im scared to be at school,"Now before I start, I would like to clarify, I am a 16 y/o sophomore girl in high school. I’m also bipolar. That plays into this.

I have been on spring break this past week. I have been dreading going back to school. Because some of my used to be friends really don’t like me. It’s so hard to process for some reason and it’s really overwhelming. I don’t feel safe at school. Not like I am going to be beat up, just the feeling of being mentally distressed. I have been trying so hard to keep my composure at school but i dont know if I’ll be able to anymore. I really am not going into the full story on why im so scared, but long story short, my best friends boyfriend hates me. We’ll call him Janice. And that caused some of my former friends to no longer like me, and cause trouble with Janice and me. Everyone tells me that Janice never talks about me BEHIND MY BACK, which i do believe. It doesn’t really take away from the fact that he belittles me in front of my friends and me. And everyone tells me about “how he really tried to like me”. Like it really changes anything at this point. I TRIED to like Janice. Hell, I used to be friends with Janice in middle school. But since he pretty much manipulated my (now ex) boyfriend into saying something personal really scared me, for him and my best friend’s relationship. So i tried to get them to break up. Looking back at it now, i know it wasn’t right and I have apologized countless times. I have told them I would never do it again. And my best friend knows that, but Janice doesn’t or he just doesn’t care. 

I just miss having people to rely on and it’s really hard. I no longer have that shoulder to cry on because I cant even go towards my best friend without Janice’s ridicule. It hurts. Cause me and her are fine now, at least thats what she says. I just really wish I never did what I did but I can’t reverse that. And i know it was wrong. I just really don’t know what to do anymore.

"I (18m) am just out of high school, and have had depression since around 8th grade.","I started exhibiting symptoms of depression in 8th grade, however I refused to accept that i was until near the end of 9th, where everyone around me was telling me to go to a therapist. In 10th, it got a little better, because I started going to a vo-tech and met new people, and I met the two people (currently 16m and 17f)(online, not at the vo-tech) that have pretty much kept me alive to this day. however everything went back downhill farther than it has ever gotten in 11th grade, where my depression prevented me from doing practically any school work, resulting in me failing.

&amp;#x200B;

in 12th grade, I was put in a program to recover my lost credits for 11th grade, and get my 12 grade credits at the same time. I recently finished this program, several months before scheduled. I no longer talk to the people at my high school, and very rarely talk to the people at my vo-tech. However I talk to the two people online almost every day.

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I met them, there has been fewer than ten days where I haven't talked to both of them. before I met them, ninety percent of my time outside of school was spent in silence on my computer, but I have spent so much time with them, that the time without seems so much more lonely than it ever did before.

&amp;#x200B;

They began dating a couple months after I met her, (he introduced me to her) and they are still dating today. I'm in no way bothered by them dating, happy for them even. The problem, (which I don't want to bring up to them because it will cause them to feel bad for me, which will change how they interact with me, and each other \[especially around me\]) is that I have a habit of causing myself to feel bad about my life. So when i see or hear something, I have a habit of linking that to something I don't like about my life. Which results in me seeing something completely random, like a cow, (pretty common around where I live) which makes milk, which relates to cheese, which is in pizza, and pizza is what I ate ten minutes before busting my chin open on the playground in 2nd grade. That was a hypothetical, however it was pretty dang close to what it is really like.

&amp;#x200B;

The most common thing for me to end up thinking about, is the fact that i have never been in a relationship, I have asked someone out, but got friend-zoned. So when we are all together, which is rare with me living in Oklahoma, him in Alabama, and her in North Carolina, it is hard for me because I end up with a self-pity party on my hands. I don't want to say anything, because it will cause them the not want to act like boy-friend and girl-friend together when I am around them.

&amp;#x200B;

another problem I have could be multiple things. I have been feeling in the past several months that my depression has been relapsing and getting either close to, or as bad as how I was in 11th grade. One of the reasons (the only one i can see, however this has only started in the past week) calls back to the third paragraph, where I said the time without them is so much more lonely. My family doesn't have much money, which means that I have a hard time traveling. So when a trip is planned for us to see each other, there is a good chance that it can't work out for me to come. So in the time that they are together, they talk to me a little bit, but they spend most of their time with just each other, which, for the record, I encourage, I can play games with him in the other 51 weeks of the year.   


&amp;#x200B;

And while I have felt my depression getting worse of the the past couple weeks, that has amplified in the past week due to the fact that I have been spending all this time alone in silence. And I have discovered that, by far, the most unhealthy thing I can do, is leave myself with only my thoughts. And while I am talking to someone, I have little time to do that. I don't want to talk about how I have been feeling recently to them, due to the fact that they will most likely link it to the fact that we haven't been talking much.

&amp;#x200B;

And to bring one last thing up before I finish, my main way to de-stress, used to be either, listening to music, or playing games, however I manage to link every song I have ever liked to something I don't like about myself, and I haven't wanted to play any game I own in awhile, I just sort of exist in a state I refer to as ""embracing my inner vegetable"" where I either lay in bed trying to fall asleep at any hour of the day (usually in between 12:30am and 6am though) lay in bed looking at my phone attempting to get out of bed and failing every 30 minutes, or, when I do manage to get out of bed, sit at my computer for watching videos I have already watched before. On week days, I am still going to a trade school (maybe? I'm not exactly sure what to call it) to learn advanced engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

finally, I've come here, because I go to them to talk about everything else, I used to go to a therapist, but those are expensive. I'm sorry for this post being so long, any spelling mistakes, and for jumping around topics as much as a 6 year old with ADHD, I'm not great at the whole essay thing.

I'm depressed for a really stupid reason but it's killing me,"I'm sorry if this is too much. I'm a second year in grad school, and during my first year I was friends with a group of people who were incredibly supportive and treated me well. I had never felt so supported in such a long time. During my second year, I started struggling with my mental health and they knew that I was going through a tough time, but I rarely asked for anything and (in my mind) was very respectful of boundaries. I realized my best friend at the time was being emotionally abusive. I found out later that many people in my friend group hated him. I cut off ties with him but he continued to try to harass me and other ppl until i told him to f off. He's called all of my friends wanting to talk about me and I don't know if he's spread rumors about me or told them my secrets. At the same time, my friends completely stopped inviting me to things, and I found out that they weren't inviting me to things in the past too. I've been so lonely and crushed seeing them hang out without me. I can't concentrate on school and all I can think about is what's wrong with me.

"I don't know what to do anymore, I just want to give up.","TW:self harm, abuse and suicide 
Im sorry if this is confusing I just needed to tell someone or something


     Ever since a young age I've dealt with depression and anxiety and a few more mental illnesses, most are hereditary. my father left on my birthday when I was three, and he left me to my physically and mentally abusive mother. I was left at home to watch over my younger sister since I was around 4. my mother would go drinking, partying and sometimes to work for many hours every night and would come back very drunk and usually angry and she would take out on my because I was the oldest or just because she didn't like me. after the neighbors calling the police so many times eventually I was taken out of that house and placed at my grandma's when I was around 5. when I turned about 7 I moved back in and my mother continued what she did, rather that be hateful words or broken bones. a little before I was 8 I began to self harm and have suicidal thought but didn't act on them due to not wanting to leave my sister and newly born brother behind. although my mother hated me she had never hurt them and I wanted to keep it that way. I was a hard worker in school and was considered gifted and talented and made straight A's and I usually tried to help with bills as well, because we did not always have enough, as the water and electricity was cut off often. it continued this way for a few years, I hated myself through all of it and had failed suicide about 3 or 4 times before I turned twelve. when in the sixth grade  many kids disliked and told me to kill myself so I tried and this time when I woke up I was in the hospital just barely alive, no one was there except a nurse. I was kept there for a few months and eventually placed in a psychiatric ward a few hours from where I lived. I was the youngest there. we were aloud to make calls and the only number I knew was my mom's, she only ever answered once and all she said was ""was it for attention? did you have fun?"" I remember saying no barely being able to speak and all she said after that was ""I can't stand you, I should not have had you"" and that I was kicked out. before I got out of the psych ward my grandma caught wind that I wasn't welcome in my mom's home so she took me in. after that my mother got sober but still did not necessarily welcome me, I was allowed to visit my siblings and the house but she didn't speak to me unless it was yelling. she never laid a hand on my siblings and she began to handle her anger but I only got worse. I continued self harming and hating myself. I was practically alone, although my grandma says she loves me she still would call me fat or ugly and she said she would love me no matter what though. but if you bring up anything LGBTQ, she states she would kick any one of her kids out if they came out so I knew once I got older she would no longer speak to me. I had a very hard time through the next couple of years. I am now in highschool and I've just turned 15, I am currently on the three year graduate plan and in many AP courses but I am making A's and B's and feel as if I'm a failure for it. I used to stay alive to protect my siblings but I am not sure if they will even remember me now even though I practically raised them when they were younger. I don't have many friends and I don't feel as if I have a future. my self harm has gotten really bad and I've tried to stop but I just can't. I feel like at this point it would be better for everyone if I just gave up.",hailee_2012,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tv1mp7/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore_i_just_want_to/
Group Therapy,"I’ve always admired the concept of AA and group therapy. I live in Staten Island NY and there aren’t many group therapy options here. Even on meetup.com there aren’t many depression support groups on Staten Island. Most of them are far into Brooklyn and Manhattan and hold meeting during business hours. I like the idea of talking to people with similar experiences or who would genuinely understand what you’ve been through or what you’re feeling. I’m not saying traditional therapy is bad, just sometimes would rather speak / vent to someone who just truly gets it and not necessarily taking pointers from a text book or only here for a paycheck. Group therapy also gives you potential to make friends. I’m posting this here to see what people would think of this?

One of the things I realized about my situation is that I will forget things surrounding when I suffer any fresh trauma. When I had to move in with my partner during the pandemic, I was already at two breakdowns in one year alone. As a result, I blanked on the several months of my life both before and after the move. I'm sure it might have felt like me gaslighting, to not remember simple things constantly, to suddenly have turned into a tear soaked idiot who can't be trusted to pick the dry cleaning up...

I'm back at that point again. I tried to have a watch fixed and botched communicating with the jeweler because in my anxiety I thought I had returned a call that I hadn't. After that I discovered that I couldn't return a power cord easily because I lost the receipt and don't even remember where I ordered it from. I simply can't remember things and honestly I don't feel safe behind the wheel of a car.

This coming week my partner is taking me to a resort for a few days but I can't stop freaking out about how I don't even have any clean laundry and the washer is broken and I'm supposed to leave tomorrow night.

How to explain my mental health to my academic advisor?,"Hello, I'm in my third year of college and final semester and I am probably going to be on academic probation as there is no way to improve my grades and bounce back. In my last semester I have to finish some assignments and find an internship to do from April 11th for a month to pass the semester and graduate. I haven't completed some assignments (that make up a huge portion of my grade) and I haven't even finished my portfolio or started sending out emails so there's no way a company will accept me now that the starting date is so close (next Monday). I'm panicking and I'm so embarrassed that my life has come to this because I know I have had depression since high school (or last years of primary school) but I haven't been diagnosed so I don't know if I should bring it up. In the past, I struggled with procrastination and always submitted assignments last minute and passed my classes and I thought I was going to do the same this semester, but for some reason I couldn't bring myself to do any of assignments (that are now long overdue) or look for internships so I'm failing. I'm also not the type to seek help and would rather fix my problems myself instead of communicating with my teachers but because I didn't talk to an academic advisor or my teachers sooner to bounce back when I had enough time, I'm in this position. I knew I wasn't passing since the midterm 3 weeks ago and my teacher even reached out to me because I haven't been coming to school for 2 months, but I thought that I could manage to complete the assignments last minute like I always have but I didn't and now it's too late. How can I explain this to my academic advisor? I have never been to therapy or diagnosed so I don't what to say and if I should bring up that I think I have depression. I have a meeting with her this Monday morning (online). I'm embarrassed because if I could've just fixed this a few weeks ago if I reached out sooner, I could've graduated like everyone else in my semester and now I don't even know if the school will kick me out or not and I'm also panicking because I don't know what to do know that I'm not graduating in 3 years like I planned to. Also I have been thinking this year that I could also have ADHD because I think I have some of the symptoms, especially ADHD paralysis, but again I'm not diagnosed and I don't even want to bring up depression to my advisor, but I don't know if being vague and saying my mental health has gone worse this semester will be enough explanation. Also I'm not the confrontational type and have been scared to properly acknowledge my depression, but because I don't know what to do anymore in regards to my grades and internship, I booked a meeting with my academic advisor and that's why I'm asking advice on what I should say. I didn't mean to make this post so long so I'm sorry about that and I also have a lot of thoughts going on in my head because of this but I tried to write this post the best I can.

To make a stupidly long story short; I've had depression for over 20 years, I've had many dark times but now I just feel hopeless and lost. 

Last June my mom, who was my closest friend, died. I realized later that is was suicide rather than accidental.

In mid February, after a 2.5 unsuccessful years of trying, I was finally pregnant. Being a natural pessimist I was cautiously excited. We told people we care about, bought some baby stuff to keep the mood as happy as possible, and were making plans and being as careful as possible as we were told two weeks ago that there was a chance for miscarriage. 

Yesterday I miscarried, we updated people via text because we haven't felt like talking since the initial warning. The people in our lives are trying so hard to help and want to be here, I appreciate it, but the one I really want to talk is my mom. I just keep sitting here, unable to focus on much, I feel so lost and lonely.

Help Me Understand Depression Better,"So real quick, most women I’ve been with have depression and are on medication. My first gf had it but she was still able to be there for me for the most part. She’d go a day or so not talking to me. Anyway, this new woman I had been dating since October was great. She told me she had depression about a month in but it didn’t bother me. Everything changed once it was the new year. They started her up on medication. Us meeting became a lot more rare. She told me that when she’s on the medicine, she spaces out. But we were still meeting somewhat frequently so it was cool. It’s now slowed down so much it’s been more than a month since we’ve met up and even messages between us are almost non existent. Is this normal? Will her medicine eventually be figured out and things will return to how they were? For the record, she tells me she still likes me but I feel the relationship can’t really even be called that if it’s been months since we’ve even seen one another.

I feel as if I am going nowhere in my life,"Hi, I'll try to make this post short. So my whole life I (F19) never really thought I'd get older or graduate high school. When I was in 6th grade I thought I'd be dead by 8th grade but then high school came along and I kind of winged it and ended up graduating. I pretty much missed out a lot in high school, I didn't go to parties I dated 2 guys and never tried again because I just felt as if I'm a boring person and I'd bore the other person with me... anyway I thought once I graduated I'd probably finally get happy and do all the things I ever wanted to do with friends. Well... things have gotten worse since I graduated and honestly wish that I could go back in time, things are much much much more complicated and my mental health has been way worse than it had been my whole life up until graduation. I am now going to community college and well haven't really accomplished anything and haven't had that ""fun"" I've always wanted. I tried to go out and have fun with my way way more outgoing friends but my parents even at 18 then wouldn't let me because ""they'll corrupt you and get you to leave us and get you to quit school"" even though my friends are also going to community college or university... They go out and are living their 20s now and don't bother to ask me anymore. Not that I'd blame them... My mother recently is also going through a psychotic break and my dad needs me home to look after her and also focus on school. i'm turning 20 in August and I feel as if my days are a loop of watching over my mom and school and work. I feel no separation between days and everything is blurring together. I feel as if I am wasting away and will never get to experience anything in my damn life let alone try dating anyone. My mom doesn't want to get any sort of help she'll get mad and storm out of the house. I have been trying to make my brother have a good time lately, I have been taking him to the movies he at least deserves to have some fun as a sophomore in high school and stuff but I'm just not living myself. I don't really see myself living past 25 I have always said that since 6th grade. So far I don't really have a reason to stay. I've hated my life my whole life so far. I have been crying myself to sleep for the past week. I can't even stand to look at posts my friends make of living their lives. I feel so trapped and things are never going to change for me. I can't exactly move out because my parents have made me so dependent on them my whole life by never letting me do anything and if I talk about moving out they start saying stuff like "" were we not good parents to you?, you're so ungrateful, We will take the car, If you move out don't even bother showing your face here again, etc.."" I feel as if I'm living on autopilot... I going to wither away forgotten. I hate myself so much, I can't even focus in my classes anymore.

"I’ve tried therapy, prescriptions, everything. Nothing left but suicide. Nowhere left for me.","I need help. This is my last desperate plead for help. If you’re interested, here’s my story. I need to leave details off because some of us are public personalities. My father was a professional athlete. My mother was a college athlete. Growing up, my siblings and I were groomed to be be athletes. I was always the best at every sport. I was first picked always. Won every first place race, ribbon and trophy. I spent my entire certain that I would play professionally. I trained as hard as possible. I sacrificed so much. Friends, girlfriends, events- all the normal kid stuff. I pushed it all aside to work to make the pros like I was assured I would by everyone around me. I excelled in college sports. I was certain to be a pro. But it turns out I was wrong. I have the will, the work ethic, the mindset of a pro but not the body. I’ve been passed up by everyone in 2 different sports. Nothing I can do will ever change the body I’m in, and it’s just not cut for pro sports. I’ve trained at %150 for 28 years and I’ll never make the cut. And now I’m worthless. To say I’m depressed would be the understatement of the ages. I hate myself for who am and am unable to change. And to salt the wound, both of my brothers are playing professionally. I’ve been in therapy for years. I’ve been on every conceivable anti depressant. I’ve tried every mantra, every strategy, every scheme to get over this soul crushing gulch. I feel worse now then ever. I feel like like I’m in a pit that keeps getting deeper, and there’s no way to climb out and there’s a gun in the ditch and the only thing for me is to use the gun and make it all stop. I’m crying writing this. Life for me is a cruel ass joke. I can’t see myself living like this for another 50 years. And I’m powerless to change anything.

so SO let down and devastated,"I’ve always struggled with depression and i’m really trying to get to the brighter side of things. I’m not a very outgoing person in general, but I am there for my friends and family all. the. time. Regardless of how I’m feeling, I always make sure they’re okay and check in on them. I have maybe 5-6 really close friends that I consider family and for the past year, I feel like i’m always a back-up plan or option. They almost all have partners and the one who doesn’t is my roommate and best friend and she never seems to want to talk to me. She works a few nights at a restaurant and when she’s home she’s always on her phone and never talks to me, but will take multiple other phone calls and talk to her other friends for HOURS and then tells me she’s done talking and just wants to watch tiktoks for the night. I text or snap her too and she never answers and then tells me “oh i’m never on my phone” when I watch her sit on her phone all day when she’s not working. I recently got a surgery (4 days ago) and I booked it 4 months in advance and triple checked up until the week before that my support system would be there for me. My other best friend who was supposed to come and stay with me and help me (I can’t lift anything and i’m on a fall watch bc of meds) texts me FIVE days prior and she tells me that she booked a cruise while drunk and she’s sorry but can’t take care of me past my actual surgery day and maybe the next day post-op appt. ok. fine. So then I call my brother and his fiancée (two more from the friend group) and tell them about her trip and they tell me to call them whenever I need them and they’ll come over. I have texted both of them multiple times and no response, and they don’t answer phone calls AND their voicemail boxes are full. ok. fine. Now I need to ask my roomie/bestie if she can help me and she gets upset at other bestie for booking a cruise and says how rude that was and promises to request off of work and take care of me. Fast forward to now, 4 days post-op and i’ve had someone with me for a total of 10-12 hours, MAYBE. Roomie-bestie sleeps in on my post op appointment day; she wouldn’t wake up and wasn’t answering my phone calls/texts and I couldn’t knock on her door bc of the surgery and I almost missed a very important appt. She KNEW about it and convinced me to tell my other bestie not to take me, that she, my roomie-bestie, should be the one to take me. Told me 4-5 times the night before, “yeah, i’ve got you” and didn’t wake up until 5 minutes before we needed to be there (and I still needed help getting ready before). Now, she sleeps in until 30 mins before her shift and stays out until 4-5am and then goes to bed until it’s work time. Then she has the nerve to scold me for lifting things or moving around too much BUT WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?!?!?! I was promised and reassured SO. MANY. TIMES. that I would have a support system here. So now. I am questioning everything. If not a single one of my friends/family will even help me after a major surgery? I am so fucking depressed. I’m in pain and alone and so drugged up from my meds and I want to just disappear off this planet because of all of this. I truly can’t believe how this is turning out.

loneliness can drive us to do all kinds of thing's,"Not just loneliness. But a desire to be seen, to be heard. To feel useful and to make progress in some way. Can I tell someone, anyone, who i am? I'm not really anyone, honestly. I use to live a pretty normal life. Expect that I was secretly miserable. Which, judging by what I've seen, that's pretty normal too. One of the few differences between now and than is that it's no longer a secret. At least, I'm not trying to keep it as one anymore.

I know it sounds cliché, but I really feel like after awhile all the thing's I kept inside start to pile up. Like, one day, it will come, and i will truly snap. I mentioned a few posts ago that my life feels like I'm just waiting for something. Something big and terrible boiling up inside me. I don't think anyone has ever quite understood what that meant. And up until recently, I don't think I did either. 

Human life perplexes me. No matter how persistent I am at trying to understand other people, no matter how hard I try to feel sorry for them, I just can't manage to.

I've learned a lot about myself these past few years. Mainly, that it's hard to constantly carry yourself through every storm, and that, it's okay to feel desperate for help and connection, even if society tries to make it seem like it's not. You can't trust everything society says. I learned that no matter how different your beliefs are compared to someone else's, it doesn't mean that their wrong or invalid. I'm not the only one with problems. I see that much more clearly now.

I even learned how to value my own life. Me. A person who doesn't fear death and hates life. But i still haven't learned the best trick of them all. The full appreciation of all life, and not just my own. The good news is, I'm not suicidal anymore. The bad news... well, I don't lack the courage and motivation to be myself anymore either. Sounds like good news, right? Then maybe you should stop reading here.

I know who I am. What i am. I'm not afraid or too dead inside to ignore it anymore. These thoughts and desires. Their not me. But i want them to be. I suck at the inherently comprising nature of philosophical debate. Too messy. So, I'll try to keep thing's simply.

Ever since I was a kid, I never understood the high value of life people always seem to speak of. To me, life was nothing. Not worth saving, not worth crying over. I know now that my perception of reality is no more true or false then anyone else's. It's just a perspective. And every perspective matters, regardless of who it belongs to. It just may not matter to everyone.

My obsession with death. Yeah, I was one of those creepy quiet kids that everyone was too afraid to get close to. Like, you could just tell something is off about them. Sounds like something straight out of a horror movie. At the risk of sounding like a cringy edgelord, as a kid, I don't think I was ever happier then when I was in a room full of people who knew just enough about me to either be afraid or at least wary enough to stay away.

There's something about conflict that spurs me on like nothing else. Pain and intimidation. The rush of a real fight. Win or lose, I love to fight. I tried to deny that part of myself, because no normal person could ever live that way. What would people think? If people knew, they'd call you a monster and so on. But I had to face it. It's part of who I am. 

Everything about this society, this world, feels like willful enslavement. My soul, (assuming I have one) longs to be free. But I've been a slave for so long that I'm not even sure what freedom looks like. I'll keep searching, for now. And if I grow bored of holding back, I think I'll be ready to let go.",Murky-Hat-3619,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuzlkz/loneliness_can_drive_us_to_do_all_kinds_of_things/

I drove my only best friend away, I moved away and we still played games together but I was just so lonely I would end up making her feel like shit for not being online and playing with me, I never meant to. I said I live next door to my mum and also my stepdad I'll add, who I've never really gotten on with, I've always been too difficult, he would constantly make me feel like shit growing up and my mum never got involved in fear she would just worsen things, I still love her, I always will. I still love my boyfriend but I feel stuck because we both made it clear neither of us want to move to each other, we are almost 400 miles away, I just know I would be even unhappier in a strange land without my mum close by so I really don't know what to do about that, it would be about the 9th move in my life. I don't talk to any of my family, we aren't on bad terms or anything we just don't talk.

NOTHING,"Hello everyone. Life has become a burden on me at a young age. I am only 18 but I feel like I’ve been a failure in these 18 years. I haven’t achieved anything like anything- people of my age surely are a part of something, have finished first or second in atleast sone competition but me nothing. I have done nothing in these 18 years that I can say I am proud of. I am bad at academics, not part of any sports team, have no talent or skills and even my communication and social skills suck. I just get so sad when I look at my parents and realise that they deserve better- they deserve a son who makes them proud which I haven’t been able to do in these 18 years. I have no friends cause I am weird, I have a bad acne and I am thin so my appearance sucks as well. I just don’t know why I even exist. I have nothing good in me. The people ik try to avoid me, I am always the last picked. It hurts when I see other 18 year olds hanging out with their friends. I want to live a normal teenage life as well. I want to make memories that will last forever as well. But I guess I just exist. Even if I disappear no one would notice. I wish I was better than.

"I know I have depression, but do others experience it the same way I do?","I know I have anxiety and depression, but I haven’t found a post that quite fits my symptoms. Granted I haven’t been able to read through them all. 

I am functional. Remote Job, apartment, decent personal hygiene, lots of people who are friendly (long distance), romantic relationship (long distance), decent looking, no external handicaps. 

I don’t leave my apartment often. I have such a hard time initiating doing physical things but when I do I know I like it. 

For most of my adult life (30) I will get this sickening feeling that will hit me randomly. It makes me imagine everything that is wrong with me. It usually hits the minute I am not consuming my mind with something. 

This feeling makes me feel like I am the most worthless shit. That life is utterly pointless. I wonder what I’m working for and what I’m walking towards. 

And then I think, “what the hell is wrong with me?” I have a decent life, I know the stuff to do that makes me happy. Just live. But you know, the idea, that I can never be rid of this feeling that creeps up on me, makes me want to run away from my own skin. 

I get by recently thinking that at the end of the day, if I start thinking that I am willing to die, then shouldn’t I be willing to do crazier things before it gets there? Like throw my money away and become a monk, or travel the world with a backpack?

But when Monday rolls around I cannot help but go to work. I cannot help be responsible and keep myself functional. I feel trapped by my own survival instincts. What is this? This horrible feeling of pointlessness? 

Its sad. I have very understanding friends. I have everything I need to be happy or at least be content. And instead, I feel like the biggest baby and victim. I don’t want to live a live where I’m just running away from the abyss within me. I don’t want to live a life where I am just distracting myself. But that seems what life has in store for me.

"a ballad for what, I feel maybe you?","you’d rather succeed than kill yourself right now, correct? So, move, stop this endless waiting, stop acting as if you’re already dead. you’ve waited your whole life to be in this moment of age. You idolized as a kid what it would be like, what you would do. Don’t be a disappointment to that kid, stop your drunken manners of self worth, your self is not bound to anything but what in you choose in that moment so go out do as unto you do. Its utterly insufferable and embarrassing of how you treat yourself. These are your thoughts? mine too. So how have we not banded together like a group of merry people, singing carols as they go? Find it, grasp it, I search and search till I gave up, I look like a rat grasping at the scrapes perhaps we are, we shall grasp till we find what they have, what you so dearly crave.

You must at least be able to do the least. What is the least? Its what you stare at constantly. for what you crave is as simple to do as breathing. Perhaps, you find this troublesome. I do how, can I possibly do it? Well, getting rid of what’s preventing you is not easy, takes guts, so in a rage murder it with dread. My bed stands unmade, why would I murder my bed? So do the opposite of suicide, live, is that not the reason you were born? To live, you may not wish it but you must do it somehow. For a bed is not what stops me. What stops me is myself, a roadblock not defeated by crashing into it, stupidity at its finest, really its what we all are. To find a way around is stupid you’ve been traveling along the wall for months or even years, you can’t tell how much. The only choice left is to cut the mortar with the knife you so play with, or boil the mortar to death for the hot water and flame you so selectively touch, it can be used for another to build.

Do you have to feel.... sad when you're depressed?,"So.... sorry idk how else to word it.

I don't necessarily feel ""sad"" or anything, but for the past year or so I've been dealing with some extreme levels of lethargy / low energy / no motivation. Like if I have nothing to do I will quite literally be in bed the entire day on my phone. Don't even feel like walking 2 meters over to sit on my computer, or turning the tv on in my bedroom. Only eat one real ""meal"" a day.

It's usually better when I'm actually out, but actually getting to that stage is tough. Like I was so close to cancelling my plans to hangout with someone for absolutely no reason. Been going on walks much less often even though I know just that helps immensely. 

 I also recently lost my job, and I've had no real motivation to look for a new one. Or well, I do ""want"" a new job and the whole social aspect alongside it, but also dread the process of job-hunting, rebuilding my resume, etc. Lately I've been having sleeping issues where I'm awake at night and asleep during most of the day, which is also getting in the way of actually going out to apply.

I only really feel sad after sunset, when I realise I wasted another day doing nothing

Anyway, all that being said, I've been ""depressed"" before, and it doesn't really feel like... what it used to feel like. Like before I was actually sad, or crying for no real reason before, but I still had motivation/energy. Now it kinda just feels... idk, empty?

"Without relationships that matter, nothing else matters and you will always be depressed","It doesn’t matter how much or how little medication.

I can’t fit into society and I’ve always been like this, more or less. I’ll be turning 30 this year. Mentally, I’m still 17 and re-living bad times. And good, too, because those were the only times I experienced a certain spiritual freedom and closeness in friendships. That’s all I want. How can one find reason to live with this kind of loneliness? Could you?

Never have I felt so,"SAD. I never felt like harming myself before. I always thought I could manage my emotions and not let them manage me. But things have gotten bad. Sometimes it feels good just to write everything down regardless of whether someone reads this. My girlfriend left for San Diego which is roughly 750 miles from where I live. We've had a rocky relationship and we both did things early on that we regret. She claims to love me but has been cheating on me since the start of this relationship. I had a porn addiction for years before we met and this carried over into the first 4-5 months of us being a couple. She had found out about it and did things to punish me. Since then I have sworn to be a better person to save our relationship. Still she wants to sleep with random guys and its deeply affecting my self esteem. I just don't understand her mentality. What makes hooking up with other men while in a committed monogamous relationship acceptable to her? I don't do these things. I know this isn't r/relationship_advice so I apologize.

I'm just tired of waking up in the middle of the night gasping for air, falling back asleep temporarily to have the same recurring nightmares. And then to wake up the next morning wondering, ""what could possibly go wrong today?""

i'm crying because my uncle who i haven't seen in years (him and basically every family member on my dad's side) texted me for the first time ever to invite me to a family reunion (i think it's his birthday) and i feel so fucking guilty for never going to see them, especially my grandma after my grandfather passed away last year. it feels weird that they talk to me like i'm a total stranger. i used to justify it by saying oh well they never come to see me so why should i go to visit them but that's just bullshit because my dad and my siblings visit them like every fucking weekend and i'm the only one who never goes, so of course they don't fucking talk to me. haven't really talked to my friends either for like a year now. every time someone wants to hang out with me i freak out or don't want to disappoint them when i eventually push them away (because i know i will) so in my head it's better to not talk to them in the first place. barely ever talk to my own brother who lives in the same house with me. some days i convince myself that i'm totally okay and doing all of this by choice but other days, like today, i think to myself: what the fuck are you doing? and everything goes downhill from there. and the cycle repeats over and over and over again. 

before someone suggests therapy, i did go for a while but i don't think it helped much + i can't afford it anymore. i also went to see a psychiatrist once and she told me i'm very sensitive and that's part of the reason why i developed really hard core anxiety when i was a kid and that transformed into depression when i got older. or something like that lol. i'm pretty sure she said i might have social anxiety but at this point i don't fucking know.

In desperate need of advice for a suicidal friend now in a psychiatric hospital [Long],"I have a friend who has been having a very tough time lately, and last night cut herself (not majorly) and was close to jumping out of a window to her death. She ended up not doing it (because of being unsure that it would kill her) but instead calling the emergency services and was then taken to hospital, followed by a psychiatric facility, where she now is. To my surprise she is still allowed her phone, so we can remain in contact almost as much as we had been (which was chatting daily, several hours, for the past month).

For a bit of background, starting a few months ago her family (really mostly her mother) started treating her coldly, and her father died. The once-tight family structure she had has fallen apart and this has hit her hard. Over the course of a few months she has developed anorexia and depression, and her mental state has spiralled. She has isolated herself, ended up with no friends around her or family, and I, an online friend a long way away from her, have been literally the only one she has had to confide in. I don't have any problem whatsoever in being there for her but I feel so inept with what I'm offering.

I have no idea what I'm doing. I've trawled the internet for information on those mental conditions but I'm no trained psychiatrist to say the least. I've tried to build up her self esteem in an honest way. I've tried to encourage her towards professional help. I've offered distracting talk about other unrelated topics. I've been trying my best but sometimes I just do not know what to say. 

She has lost all hope for her future and I don't know how to show her that the way she's feeling now doesn't have to be permanent, and that she is the very opposite of the worthless, overweight, parasitic person she describes herself as. 

The problem is, her family situation might actually be permanent. So I'm quite stuck when it comes to that - it's no good me saying it will if she knows better than me that it really won't. She also seems greatly bothered by the perceived meaningless-ness of life, as she has no belief in a higher power (nor do i if it matters but this doesn't bother me). She is reading religious texts in the hope that something convinces her otherwise but I strongly doubt she's going to find it, and I don't know of any reading material I could point her towards that would convinced her of some meaning in a godless universe.

Also she has all this delusional guilt and shame and feelings of being a fraud, both as an anorexic and a depressed person (she is absolutely 100% both of those things, in terms of behaviours, thoughts, and physical consequences). This appears to be rooted in what sounds like a childhood of having her mental struggles and worries belittled, and a mother that does not believe that mental illnesses are a real thing and has been very cruel towards her in recent months and weeks when she has expressed what's been going on with her. So, she downplays her current traumas, and I just cannot get through to her that she is justified in feeling the way she does, and in receiving professional help for it.

In short, she has lost hope, she doesn't see her situation ever improving and doesn't see that it even matters. She really is the most wonderful person and it's really breaking my heart knowing she's like this. I'm lost and do not know what I can do to help change her mind. Although with that said, she has been put on an anti-depressant from today so that might help.

But what can I say when she talks about being worthless and fraudulent and undeserving and all that stuff? Nothing seems to penetrate her fog of depression.

i'm so confused...,"i'm diagnosed with depression for a year now. as much as i heard of mental health...depression(i watch some youtube vids like psy2go about different mental illnesses simply because i'm curious)...therapy...medication before having depression, i'm confused af about what this is/what's happening to me. i'm on SSRI for a year now. when i got depression, it was out of nowhere. i was just fine, and then BOOM, i'm completely down in the pit. it's not subtle and it's not slowly creeping in. it do start with little bit of insomnia. but i wasn't sad. just constant having to deal with school and stuff so my mind is busy 24/7. i'm very stressed but i wasn't sad. then it turned into i feel irritated easily,  everything makes me annoyed. but i tried to keep my calm and i keep living. then my thoughts start to lose control, my vision start to turn dark despite the weather or lighting. i can't eat. i wanna cry all the time, i can get angry to the point i pant just having thoughts. then unexplainable suicidal thoughts come, my body feels drained and even dying doesn't feel anything to me. i then started taking medicine and i slowly am able to function again. before i wasn't able to talk or even engage in a conversation. now i can. my visions are normal. i don't throw up when i'm angry. but just...there's some part of me like they're never coming back. i don't view the world same anymore, yes changing ur views are part of life or growing, but it's just so weird. even if someone tell me it's normal i just don't think it's normal. i feel like my morals are off. i am no longer confident in any stands i have. i have memory problem that days blend and i'm just existing. people say depression is common but even if so nobody's depression feel the same. the more it try to reach out for help the more confused i get. some say don't think the depressed you is who you are. but how do i know if i'm really depressed. a friend told me not to divide the two but i just...don't know what to do anymore. i don't even what's happening to me, so i don't even know how to get help. i reach out to a therapist but therapy is honestly much harder then i think it is. i don't know where to start, i don't know how it can help. people just relate mental illnesses to therapy as if it's the answer to everything but nothing makes sense anymore and i feel like...i have nothing to grab on i just live everyday while everyday means literally nothing. i do live. i do sometimes feel little bit of things. but sometimes everything is just flat, nothing is there. i don't talk to friends anymore because i don't know who i am anymore, and i don't wanna say something that isn't me but depression makes me think of it. i feel like i can never make sense of what happened in this year and...brain fog, confusion, whatever the heck it is i'm never gonna have a life where i know what i've lived through. there's still so much more that i haven't typed it out...there's just too many things...

I’m not sure what to call this… I’m really sorry.,"Could it be a bad idea to try to get a job when you’re constantly forgetting what you’re doing and confused and blanking?I’ve been applying for jobs for quite a while but I haven't tried applying for jobs in a few days because I don't know if maybe this would mess stuff up. Does this sound like I'm making excuses? I worry that maybe I’m subconsciously making excuses for myself and think it’s real. When I first see a job that I want to apply for, I’ll feel like it could be fun and I’ll feel excited… but right after I’ve applied I feel so scared and like there’s no way I could do a good job or learn quickly and all I feel about it is dread… I don't know what to do... 

Lately I cry even more because I don’t know if any of how I’m feeling is real and I don’t know how to figure it out…

I also feel really frustrated and angry all the time over everything and I break down and cry. The other morning, while I was in bed, I couldn’t get my blanket in the exact position I wanted and I got so frustrated and cried… (this isn’t really a new thing for me though..)

I can’t really function well anymore… I was never a high functioning depressive (if that’s a thing), but now it’s gotten so much worse. I’ve been severely depressed practically my entire life and, now, after all this time, I feel like everything is ending and like I’m shutting down… :( Like there’s nothing left. I feel like I’m dying. And I feel like nothing, I guess. In just these past three months I’ve gotten so much worse and I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I can ever get better.

"No Motivation, dont know if depression. Dont have goals but have unrealistic wants.","I am lost and have nowhere to go. I barely started my Bachelors and I am now going on to my second semester (I did not pass any of my exams in my first semester). I dont even know how this whole University thing works, like am I a second semester student?? Point is, I just recently broke up with my boyfriend  (been together a bit over 6 year) because of our parents, who are all opposing us. We knew it might happen but only with his parents and not mine, but turns out everyone is against us so we thought its the only way.. to break up. I am super angry and sad at the same time. I sort of found a life I wanted to live when I was with him and I had envisioned something I could do that would make me relatively happy because its with him in my life. But now I have lost it all and any kind of motivation I had, any hopes I had  and any desires that I had are gone. We were in a long distance relationship, him in Australia and me in Germany. I was planning to move to Australia to be with him and live together, but now it all went down the toilet. I also feel like I didnt try hard enough earlier to try and go there. Not that I didnt want to but some why.... I didnt, and I really dont know why. I hate myself for not having pushed harder. I also feel like an imposter, I got here not on my own strength but Im here. I feel like Im just wasting my parents money because Im not getting anywhere and have no goals. Im not even trying for my classes but I feel so bad and I really want to. I got accepted into what I wanted but now I feel 0 motivation. However I am also so scared to just leave it. I want to start working but I feel I will do everything wrong. I fear rejection, I fear not try, I fear everything. I want to find a therapist/psychologist but Im not even successful in that. I feel like dying, without dying. I want to live without living. I want to exist without living, yeah.   
Im so bad at structuring my story and feelings Im sorry but I needed to rant and need help or words to help me out of this hole. I tell myself things, things that motivate me for a mere millisecond. But the moment I move to work on it, its just gone. I feel so bad.

i’m tired of acting okay when i’m not.,"sorry, this post is all over the place but i have to get it off my chest. 

i’ve been depressed for a couple years now but everyone around me was always like “you’re young you have nothing to be depressed about” and i started to believe them. 

i started invalidating my own feelings, because on paper my life seems perfect, and i really don’t have anything to complain about. i’m so exhausted though, i’ve tried to off myself twice and still none of my family members have tried to get me help. it’s not like i had friends either, so it’s not like i could go to them. 

a couple months ago, i did make a friend though. exciting, right? but it doesn’t really feel like it. i made sure to be transparent and tell him about my depression, and he said if i’m ever feeling down i can’t talk to him about anything. it doesn’t really seem like it though. 

if i tell him i’m tired, it’s “well i didn’t get off work till 4a and had to get up three hours later” or “i’m on day #2 with no sleep rn, you’re fine. if i tell him i’ve got a really bad headache and feel like throwing up because i didn’t have the energy to eat, he’ll say “i go without eating all the time, suck it up.” he does this with big stuff too. if i ever need to vent and tell him about how i can’t take living anymore and wanna end it, he just says “omg, me too, twins.

i’m always there to listen about how his day went, and i never try to make it about me. he doesn’t get this concept. 

so recently i’ve started just not telling him anymore. 

so yea, i’ve been trying to act okay for years and i finally thought i had someone to be open with. but no, i have to act okay and comfort him, when every single day is torture for me. this is only making things worse for me, why do i have to help solve his problems and get nothing in return?

i honestly might end our friendship because, if he doesn’t know how to comfort people, that’s totally fine. but he doesn’t have to minimize my problems and change the subject. atp, why would you even offer support if you know you won’t go through with it?

TL;DR every time i tried to vent, my friend made it abt himself. i stopped telling him abt things and still comfort him. it’s draining me mentally though and i don’t know how much more i can take.",No_Policy_1380,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tur16s/im_tired_of_acting_okay_when_im_not/

Started a new hobby to get me outside,"This entire pandemic-particularly this past winter-made me realize that being a home-body has made my negative feelings so much worse. I worked from home the last two years and played video games all day. I really didn’t go outside much. 

I decided to start a hobby that will involve being away from electronics and getting exercise. So I started a garden. And today I finally planet my seeds outside. It actually was really helpful to take me away from the negative self-talk and intrusive thoughts. It allowed me to hyperfocus on something else. I spent about two hours getting everything done and I feel really good about it. 

I’m going into it with the thought of this being a life long hobby. If I fail this year, I intend to try again next year. I saw a Ted-talk on YouTube that talked about it being okay to fail on your first try, so I’m going to keep that with me.

Cutting Ties?,"Hello reddit....  I'd say that my posts are mostly me just talking about my feelings in a way which allows me to get a little bit of the weight off of my chest and not suffer the consequences....  But today I'm asking a question.  First I have some explaining to do.  I grew up in a strict Christian household with an even stricter Father.  When the church didn't have an opinion on something my father did.  Which meant that I had a very unique childhood to say the least.  I was homeschooled for my entire childhood.  I started community college at the equivalent of my sophomore year of high school and would graduate with my associates degree at the same time as I graduated from High School.  However, I did not receive my degree as my classes had been selected to be taken as Audits by my parents who didn't feel like I would learn enough while I was still in high school and not only focusing on college  I finished with a 3.9 unweighted in HS(because I was homeschooled) and would have gotten a 3.8 for my associates if my classes had counted.  And for the last 2 years after graduation I have been working on retaking those classes and getting my degree for real this time.  Non more towards the strict part of my childhood.  I had never played video games until I was a junior in Highschool.  So you might wonder what I had filled my time with throughout my teenage years.  Well, I participated in two sports. Soccer and swimming.  I started out playing soccer at 7 but was only allowed to play until I was 12, but i wanted to continue playing so I paid for it myself.  I would go on to play for various club levels before making it to high school and only playing for a local high school team as I was also in college at the time.  However, I would make varsity all 4 years of high school and the team would win 3 state championships with me regularly starting during 3 of those seasons and 2 of those titles.  Swimming was more of something on the side.  However, I would finish top 10 individually in my state(in my event) every single year of high school.  To pay for my obsession with sports I would start doing yard work at 13 and would work as a life guard at a pool near my house as soon as possible to help pay for the rest of the bills and as crappy as this sounds the only way I could get a ride to sports was either to pay my parents for the gas, or get a ride.  Once I was old enough I got a car and things would be simpler.  When I was about to finish my senior year I was discussing where I was going to go to school for the next few years.  When I brought up the opinion that I would just do a few years having already finished my associates my dad told me that I hadn't.  I had worked for 4 years on high school, 3 years on my degree, 5 years on paying for sports on my own to be slapped in the face by that.  He simply didn't think that I ""had it"".  I had to shoulder a tremendous mental strain for 5 years getting next to no sleep between work, schooling, and sports for that.  When I told him how well I had done he said it didn't matter.  So we started arguing.  I told him how much I had worked, how much time, effort and the amount of money I had put into doing ""good"" to being a child he would be proud of.

And that was the issue right there.  He didn't care.  He told me that he had ""never been proud of me' not for anything that i had done.  He said that sports were a waste of time, that while he was impressed he wasn't proud.  He had never gone to college so me taking the classes in High School didn't really matter to him.  A job was great and he was happy that I had worked hard.  But being a lifeguard was bad.  Or so he thought.  

Here the lens of examination will turn to me.  My personality is one of trying to do the best.  Whether it was in sports, school, or my job.  I wanted to help others and be the best I could be.  Well, I naturally like most kids sought approval from my parents, so when I didn't receive it at first I thought that I had to try harder, do better, be better.  

After my father told me that it was done.  I moved out.....  Or tried too.  I had some complicated health issues.  Some of which are known to be caused by excessive stress.  One other thing is that I suffered from suicidal thoughts and depression on a scale I had never suffered from before.  After a year I was able to move out.  Having dealt with the physical Health issues but not having dealt with the suicidal thoughts and depression.  While I moved out  I wasn't able to move too far away. As the only place I was able to afford and pay tuition at school was about 15 miles away.  I've been living on my own for about a year now.  And was only 1 semester away from completing my associates.  But my dad started talking about the things he wanted me to do with it.  How, my degree could help him.....  So I quit my classes and stopped really talking to them.  I have my own expectations for my life, my own thoughts, my own beliefs.  I want it to be my life.  Where I only answer to myself as I strive to be who I want to be.  However,  I don't know if I should cut my family off completely.  Because I can't separate them from my father.  I have recently looked into moving away entirely to a different country. Where I have already found a job opportunity(no offer yet) and multiple possible places to live.  I don't really know where all of this is coming from.  But my question is this.  Should I cut them off?  

&amp;#x200B;

For me I don't know.  However,  I feel like if I cut them off I'll have at least the mental weight will be bearable with only the items I choose.  Sorry for how long this is.

I need help getting help,"To say I’m not good at asking for help is a huge understatement. The truth is, I will do everything in my power to avoid opening up to anyone. I’ve always been that way. For a long time it made me feel strong, it made me feel invincible knowing I could get myself through anything. I had to for a long time.

And now it’s just become kind of who I am. In everyone else’s eyes, I’m the positive, happy, level-headed, stable one. On the inside, I’m completely empty. I have been for years. My friends met me long after I had broken. That’s one of many reasons it’s so hard for me to open up.

They’d obviously help me and still love me if I opened up to them about how much I struggle, but the undeniable truth is that it would completely blindside them and they’d either not believe me or they’d be taken aback at how much of myself I’ve hidden from them for so long. And even if I did open up to them, I can’t shake the thought of, *what’s the point? No one is going to understand me better than I do.* I can’t shake the thought that no matter what their response is, I’m going to be frustrated that they can’t really help me (not angry with them, just even more hopeless for myself). In my head, all I’m hearing is, “What are they going to say that I haven’t heard before?” 

There’s also the factor that every conversation about our problems always seems to turn into one person trying to one-up the other. I have zero interest in that.

My family simply isn’t an option. They don’t believe in mental health. Yeah. Ironically, I can confidently say they’ve got some long-unaddressed mental health issues, some more than others.

And the truth is, I don’t know if I want to completely unlearn my emotional independence. It can be extremely excessive and harmful, but it also makes me who I am. The truth is, it is the one thing that consistently gives me a sense of control. I don’t really have a desire to open up to my friends.

But I do need help. The only person I want to talk to is a therapist. But I don’t know how to find one, how to pay for it, anything.",throwawaylol593748,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuql91/i_need_help_getting_help/

avoiding deep relationships so i could cut them off anytime,"For the past years, I’ve been keeping a distance from everyone I interact with. Just enough to call them a friend or acquaintance, but nothing more than that, so when I actually try to leave everything behind, there wouldn’t be anyone holding me back.

I grew afraid of people. Especially during the pandemic, I feared going outside and interacting at all. Still, I can pretend to be normal with empty faces and conversations. It’s disgusting. People are disgusting and so am I. Even trying to open up leaves me empty and makes me hate myself more.

I want to end it but I'm scared of hurting others,"I've been debating suicide for a couple years now, and I keep being told ""everything is going to be fine"" ""don't give up"" ""it'll all get better soon"" but nothing changes. I quit my job because we were severely underpaid and understaffed. I've been cheated on or left for an ex in almost every single relationship I've been in. I've been stabbed in the back by most of my friends that I've called family. I smoke weed because antidepressants have no effect on me, and lately everytime I smoke I get a horrible anxiety attack that makes me feel like my heart is going to burst. So for the past couple I've been drinking myself to sleep every night, and if I dont then I don't sleep.

I've asked a bunch of people for advice but i just get hit with the ""you need medication"" bs that never works. I don't think seeing a therapist for help either because I'm such a big over thinker. Especially when I'm alone and I'm sober, I overthink about my whole life. These last couple of days have been the hardest because I want to end it all, but I dont want to hurt the people I love/care about.

I haven’t achieved anything like anything- people of my age surely are a part of something, have finished first or second in atleast sone competition but me nothing. I have done nothing in these 18 years that I can say I am proud of. I am bad at academics, not part of any sports team, have no talent or skills and even my communication and social skills suck. I just get so sad when I look at my parents and realise that they deserve better- they deserve a son who makes them proud which I haven’t been able to do in these 18 years. I have no friends cause I am weird, I have a bad acne and I am thin so my appearance sucks as well. I just don’t know why I even exist. I have nothing good in me. The people ik try to avoid me, I am always the last picked. It hurts when I see other 18 year olds hanging out with their friends. I want to live a normal teenage life as well. I want to make memories that will last forever as well. But I guess I just exist. Even if I disappear no one would notice. I wish I was better than.

My blue thoughts,"We Muslims follow a lunar calendar for religious stuff. One of the important months is Ramadan when we fast and stuff. Many Muslim countries still look for the moon/crescent to verify the beginning of the month.

I live in an area when if the conditions are right you'd be able to see the crescent with the naked eye. Me and my mom always tried to find the crescent and succeeded 5 or 6 times.

I saw this year's Ramadan's crescent without her. The second I saw it the first thought that came to me was let me call mom to see this, followed by the next thought the she's dead she can't come.

These little things are things that hurt most, reminding me I am alone, more alone then I was when she was alive. The thing is I know I'll always be alone, I am jealous of people going on with thier lives. Doing things, fucking living. 

Here I am, standing still, nothing to show, not content, not happy. Tbh I don't remember being happy. One part of my mind is screaming at me for being a failure and to end it, other telling me there is still time.

I don't want to die, but I don't want to keep feeling like this either. People say these cracks and breaks in us makes us unique, but I'd rather be not sad then be unique. Is that too much of an ask?

Nothing has changed,"I had two very bad years in 2019 and 2020 that culminated in me having a mental breakdown, losing my job because of COVID, being evicted and ending up in a homeless shelter. In early 2021, I managed to pull myself together, get another job, and move in with a relative. By the end of the year, I'd bought a new (used) car, found a great counselor, and moved into my own apartment.

Unfortunately, things have gone downhill lately, which has made my depression worse. Today I got so desperate that I called a crisis hotline. I'd called them in 2019 and 2020, and they hadn't been much help. I'd usually end up talking with someone who sounded bored, uninterested, or like they were reading off a script. The worst were the ones who would say nothing. But today I figured that it's been two years, during which there was more focus on mental health, so the hotlines are probably better now.

Wrong. I ended up with a woman who parroted what I said back to me and cut me off after 5 minutes with ""you're so brave for reaching out, call us again if you need us.""

How could we have spent two years in a pandemic, when school leaders and politicians and doctors were railing about Americans needing more mental-health support, then ended up with no changes in the most accessible support system? I know counselors aren't easier to get, especially if you don't have insurance or a high income. Primary care doctors aren't any more aware of mental health issues, and the wait to see a psychiatrist is still more than six months on average. And on the one free, widely available resource -- the hotlines -- the volunteers have good intentions but still no clue how to help. Why didn't we do something in those two years to improve training instead of just talking about it?

Sorry for the rant. I'm just scared that my depression is going to eat me again, and I'm pissed that it looks like this country hasn't done anything to make it easier for me and others to get well.",throwaway_girl_83,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuvvyp/nothing_has_changed/
Heartbroken and lost,"Currently going through divorce and leaving my wife of 9 years. It's been really rough these past couple of weeks. Our house is about to be in the market to sell, and I don't know where to go and where to live. Plus, the idea of separating our pets has become really hard on me. They've all grown up together and established as a pack. Separating them in different environments will be hard for them and I'm in pain just thinking about it.

While going through my divorce, I met this amazing couple. Person X (not revealing her name), which we met previously through a professional environment. Our professional relationship transitioned to friendship throughout the months, which we eventually started hang out outside of work after she quit her job. I met her husband and we all three got really close, really fast, in a platonic way, and established a strong connection. I have no family and I started seeing them as family. I don't have a relationship with my actual family, for reasons I don't want to get into. I felt like we built a bond together and got really close. I really enjoyed their company and kept me sane while I was going through my divorce.  I was genuinely happy around them. I finally allowed myself to be vulnerable and opened up my heart to them. However, our friendship broke after a strange occurrence (I'm not going to get into it), which I tried to reach out to Person X and explain my side of the story. I got a vague reply text, which to me it seems that I might not ever hear from her again. I'm really saddened by this and I kept replaying the incident in my head if I could've done something differently that day to prevent it from happening. I think I might have jeopardized my friendship with them and I'm absolutely devastated.

I am now grieving two losses, my wife and my friends. I don't know what to do and how to proceed with life. It's becoming unbearable and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",thrw_awy_acct23,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuz5r2/heartbroken_and_lost/

I'm 20(M) and I don't know what to do anymore. Please help me,"&amp;#x200B;

Basically I don’t know what to do anymore , I feel trapped as if I want to live a life that I want to but I can’t because I hate myself so much. It’s almost like I’m locked in jail without actually being in jail it’s a very weird feeling. My whole life even when I was a kid I would look in the mirror and hate the way I look so to combat this I would grow my hair out long and not talk to anyone and stay quiet out of fear of being made fun of. I did this all throughout high school and consequently literally did nothing in high school while everyone else was having fun. I never got made fun of in high school which is a plus thank god probably because I didn't talk to anyone or never went out. So right there wasted 4 years of my youth. And now wasting almost 4 years of college. Still to this day I hate the way I look and nothing got better for me mentally. Every girl I have spoken to that had interest in me as of recent ghosted me and I’ve never even had sex before which makes me even more depressed because nobody wants to be intimate with me. I've had so many opportunities to be intimate with women when I was younger and I literally just never did it because I hated myself so much and never made a move and showed disinterest even though I was. But now I actually want a girlfriend and somebody who cares about me and I know it wont ever happen because I'm socially awkward and terrified whenever I talk to strangers.  I can’t help but think negatively every single day of my life I constantly have these voices in the back of mind telling me to just kill myself and stop being a pussy. I live with constant fear from the outside world. I can’t believe I’ve gone this far in life without killing my self I truly don’t want to fucking live anymore and it burns me on the inside. I’m surrounded by loving caring individuals but nobody really knows what’s going through my head everyday. Everyday I feel like I’m just going through the motions day in and day out. I’m never happy and I literally can’t remember the last time I was genuinely happy. I have friends that are enjoying their lives going out having fun, meeting people, having sex with girls and I’m over here depressed and basically giving up. I'm just really depressed every single day and if its not depression its extreme anxiety. I've had such bad anxiety my entire life and never got help because nobody in my family believes in mental illness and when I was younger I told my mom that it was bad and she never believed me and said I was being dramatic. So basically my whole youth was spent being a mental wreck and nobody doing or helping me at all. It just makes me really fucking upset because nobody not even my parents went out of their way to see if I was ok. NOBODY. And I'm not the type of person to tell someone I'm having mental problems because I tend to keep the pain inside and hide it from others. I've gone my entire life just ""living"" and not truly enjoying life experiences. I literally cry almost everyday when I'm alone just feeling helpless and there's no escape and it seems like the only way out is death. I'm constantly trying really hard but I cant keep living like this. I recently just broke out in tears to my mom and told her how I've been feeling my entire life and recommended me to go talk to a therapist. But I don't wanna talk to a random person who has no choice but to listen to my problems because they are getting paid for it, I want someone who genuinely cares about me to listen to my pain and not even my mom could understand. I'm a fucking grown man and I've been living in autopilot missing out on the best years of my life. I go to sleep every night praying I don't wake up and have a painless death so I can finally escape this shit world and my shit life. Every time I leave my house I constantly am fearing people judging me to the point where I cant be myself because that fear is always in my head. Imagine not being able to go outside or do anything just because you're scared of what people think about you. This literally destroys me mentally when I go to simple tasks like going to the store, I'm worrying about how I sound, how I look, what I say, how I act, and its so bad to the point where it becomes debilitating. I cant fucking control it, the only time I feel relaxed is when I'm drunk but when I drink I get depressed like its a fucking loophole. If I'm not super anxious I'm depressed and if I'm not super depressed I'm anxious. Like this is no way to live, I wouldn't wish this kind of life on my worst enemy. And now as I'm getting older I have to worry about what I'm going to do with my life and news flash I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA. I have no confidence or trust in myself to do anything with my life so I don't feel worthy enough to actually try. I'm doing poorly in school this semester because my mental state has severely declined this year. It got so bad to the point where I almost killed my self last week.

Need an AD for fatigue/anhedonia/motivation,"*I am not suicidal, just very depressed and hopeless at the moment. I need help, but I've got enough reason to live.*

I've tried Prozac decades ago, and it did not work. I forgot why. I was on a high dose of cymbalta for years, and it did nothing to help but made my dick numb and couldn't cum from sex. I combined it with Abilify and it turned me into a dopamine fiend, addicted to sex gambling, coke, and any risky behavior. That was 6 years ago. Now I'm on wellbutrin and can cum from sex easier but also on trazadone (mostly for sleep), and it has completely killed my sex drive. I used to wish I could cut my sex drive in half so I could focus more on work, but now my drive is like 0/10. A girl could ask to suck my dick rn and d say, ""Thanks, but maybe next week.""

Nothing has helped. I am desperate right now. I told my PCP that I wanted to try MAOIs like parnate. She said she could prescribe it, but it would be her first time,and she would feel more comfortable having me try viibryd or trintillex first. I am searching for real psychiatrists, but they all have like 2 month waiting lists. 

Ever since then, I've been researching and comparing, and it sounds like all antidepressants suck and even if they do help, then I won't be able to orgasm.

I can’t take it anymore,"I’m so tired of not being understood. I’ve been depressed for the past year and my family has no remorse.

They constantly complain how I never spend time with them when literally all my energy goes towards trying to stay alive.

I’ve tried explaining to them multiple times how I feel but they don’t care.

I’ve never said a word to them about how they treat me but all I ever hear is how bad of a daughter and sister I am. All I ever hear is how selfish I am. How I don’t care about my family.

Today my mom started yelling at me for not helping out with dinner when I was just sitting peacefully doing my assignment for school. She started yelling how selfish I am, how I’m depressed for no reason, how I’ve ruined this family, how I’ve ruined her life etc.

I didn’t talk back or offend her in any way. I decided to go for a walk instead to clear my mind.

She called me and started screaming at me to get back home - I didn’t want to escalate the situation so I did what she screamed at me to do.

I came her to going off at me telling me stuff I’ll remember for the rest of my life. 
I decided that I should just defend myself and I started talking back. I explained to her that I haven’t done shit to her or said a sigle disrespectful word  to her. 
Once I started getting really mad she kept saying “I’m sorry, I’m sorry I really am” and “I was just mad in the moment”. 
That pissed me off even more so I kept telling her everything I felt.

That’s when my brother got involved and started telling me how weird and childish I am for being depressed over nothing and that I should stop yelling. 

I didn’t listen to him cause I’ve just felt so fucking inferior the past few months never sticking up for myself.

Everyone was telling me to calm down but why tf should I calm down when my own mother tells me that I’ve ruined everyone’s lives for just being depressed. For just fighting in SILENCE by myself for so long. Never getting them involved cause I didn’t want them to get affected by my dumb problems.

He started pushing me and hitting me telling me to shut up and go in my room. This hurt me more emotionally than it’ll ever do physically. 

I decide to stay in my room and skip dinner cause I can’t stand seeing my family anymore. My mom decided to come in my room begging me to go eat dinner. That my brother didn’t mean what he did. That she didn’t mean what she said.

I’m so tired of not being understood. No one genuinely cares about me and they wonder why I don’t talk to them and why I isolate myself. Because this is how they really feel about me.

I’m just the dumb, emotional, childish younger sister. My feelings aren’t real.

Why couldn’t things have just been good? Why couldn’t you have just been healthy and treat me well? I didn’t deserve any of this. I physically cannot cope. I want to end it all. There’s nothing left to live for. Every single person has hurt me. 
I tried all distractions, and they just make me feel emptier. But I don’t have it in me to keep fighting. I’ve been fighting for my entire life and just keep getting fucked over by every single person that I get close with.

Hey, it's my first time posting here. I'm really at a dark place in my life right now. As per the title, I really don't see any point why I'm still here and living. I'm a college student, and it burns me out. I don't enjoy studying anymore like I used to when I was in high school. I was an overachiever, I had a lot of awards, medals but now, I feel like I'm a lost cause. I don't know if I really wanna study anymore, I don't know what job I want to do, I just want to do nothing. But I can't. I grew up in a family where your self-worth is based on your productivity and your achievements, they don't pressure me but I know they're expecting from me. Being an only child, my mom confides in me with any problem and it's becoming my problem too. We're struggling financially, my mom has no job, we rely on my aunt's food and clothes on some. I'm so tired of feeling like I will be dependent on others. In fact, I don't like depending on anyone because I know they can use it against me. Almost all of my things are given by my relatives, luckily I got in a state university, we don't have to pay for anything. And with that, I can't afford therapy and medication. I only have a few bucks left from my savings and that won't even last for 2 therapy sessions, so it won't make any sense too. I only have 2 friends. Both of them are my friends from highschool and one is with now in college and we have the same major but I don't wanna go to her for this because I know she's been burtnout too. The other's in a different university and we seldom talk now. I'm an introvert too, plus with severe social anxiety so I don't have that much opportunity to make friends. My family thinks I'm alright cause I'm always ""studying"" wherein fact I just spend most of my time crying and not learn anything. I actually feel dumb. I have high-functioning depression. I may seem put together but I'm literally broken into pieces and I don't know who I am.  I just think this is the only thing I could get something off of my chest.

I've lost the only person who actually cares about me,"The only person who held me accountable. 
Maybe they were abusive,  but maybe I was out of control.
I never had anyone to rely on. I never had a family. I never had parents.
I just found solace in the partners I dated. Then where did I end up?
My meaningful friendships have degraded over time. Probably because everyone gets sick of being around me. I am obnoxious, oblivious, and self centered.
I have no love left for myself. 
The thought that I'm losing the one who was there for me no matter what,
I dont want to be alone with myself. 
I have anxiety and I dont have any positive thoughts about myself. I assume everyone hates me.
I'm probably very hateable.
I dont sleep around but I notice I want someone to rest with all the time. If I don't have someone near me it's like i fall apart.
So I am always constantly trying to be out of my mind, to the point where i cant even entirely remember the details of the prior day. To escape my anxiety, that everyone hates me.
I don't know what's wrong with me. I just wanted to get these thoughts out of my head.
I wish I didn't need the affirmation, and I wish I didnt resort to such embarrassing states of mind to escape sober anxiety.",KeepTryingtrying,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuv3j1/ive_lost_the_only_person_who_actually_cares_about/

I can’t see out of my depression,"I’m having a hard time seeing anything else other than depression and anything involving therapy. I’m a teacher and I’m grad school so my life kind of revolves around these 3 things.

I literally live for my therapy days because I can just talk about depression and my other issues without fear of judgement.

A horrible night.,"I haven't felt this bad in forever.

I've had a big crush on a girl I've known since the 3rd grade but haven't talked to since the 10th grade and I've been trying to muster up the courage to talk to her.

Tonight was the Highschool prom. I thought if I asked her to the prom after not talking to her for 2 years would be going to far.
I didn't attend prom because I had nobody to go with (and tickets were $50 each, started at $25 but moved to $50) my only friend I have who did go told me she was there. With another guy.

Now I just feel horrible, I feel like there isn't much to look forward to now. Tbh she was kinda the only thing pushing me forward (NOT suicidal though) and now I've really got nothing.

I already feel like a disgrace to the family name, Baysura family, I feel useless and now I just feel like a complete idiot  and a loser. I've never felt so broken before...

Driving school is destroying my private life,"I've been in driving school for the last 2 years, and stuck on the theory test. My grandma kept bringin it up all the time. I'd talk with her about anything, and 10 min in, she mentions it. Or it's the first thing she says. And I don't even know why it doesn't work (me in driving school). But she keeps berading me. How much money it costs (I'm in germany and enrolling already was multiple 100€), and how I could already be done. 

(I never wanted to enroll in the first place, but I genuinely have no idea why I can't do it.)

So in turn I didn't want to talk as much to her. Then it turned into the only thing she talks to me about is driving school.

And after I ignored one (1) such text of hers, she recently told my mom that she doesn't want anything to do with me anymore.

Before this, the people I was closest to were her and my mom.

And something else I've really grown to dislike about talking to her is, she asks me something about my work, and when I explain she just cuts me off,  and says that she doesn't understand that anyways, and can't check if it's true. Same thing happened when I started learning japanese, she asked me how you say ""human"" in japanese. When I gained that knowledge and told her, I got that same answer. [It's 人 (pronounced either hito or jin depending on context) btw]

Sorry that this isn't specifically about depression, but it's really contributing to my mental state at the moment, and I have no one to talk to about this.

It's Getting Bad Again and My Appointment Isn't for another Week,"I've been going through crazy highs and crazy lows recently, up until I was taken advantage of by a guy at a party, and it's pretty much been consistent lows with occasional good days.

I can't do my homework anymore. I used to get straight A's and now I'm failing math. I skip class some days since the profs don't take attendance and I either overeat or only eat protein shakes at 130 calls per serving.

I don't talk to my friends. They think I'm quiet until I get drunk and overshare about shit. I worry they hate me all the time. When they text in the group chat, I think I'll say the wrong thing so I either don't say anything or I play it cool. I think they're closer to each other than me, but I do believe they care about me.

I am paranoid all the time. I think that he's going to break in and hurt me. My roommate is bad at locking the door and I have panic attacks about it. I check my room before I go to sleep, lock the door, and make sure I recheck everything if I leave. I keep pepper spray under my pillow sometimes. 

The last time I talked to my uni mental health support therapist I ended up crying for most of the session, and the coping strategies didn't work so she said a follow-up with the psychiatrist who said taking meds might be beneficial would be the way to go. 

I made it. It's late next week, but it's been the longest week ever. I don't know what to do, and even when I get there, it's still going to be a long fucking path. It seems so far away. How do I reach it? Everything feels numb and pointless and like I'm moving on because the me 4 months ago would be so pissed if I just gave up.

I'm a subhuman. Nothing more,"2 years ago I had my first suicide attempt. I had those thoughts for 10 years, since I was 13, and it took 11 years of misery until I had that first attempt. There were so many reasons that went into that and they just kept kept compounding and adding up over those 11 years. The first thing, that made me want to opt out, was when I realized I was gay at 14. Truth is I knew long before then even but that's when I knew for sure, it wasn't going anywhere. That's always been reason enough but as i got older and I started having basic life problems, It got worse and worse. Being fat and ugly,  having no real passion, no real career where I made enough to live on,  no purpose, no friends, no relationship, the problems that come with being broke, etc. Most are minor problems on their own and the ones that weren't minor could be fixed with enough time and effort. Some could not though.  After my near death attempt, I went into therapy and learned that. I started tackling some of those problems, I took control what I could.  I started school,  went on a weight loss and fitness journey,  tackled some other basic life problems that was in my control.... but I was still miserable despite all that. And lately I've been realizing why. The root of all this,  has always been being gay. There is no fix to that. There's no place in society for me.  To most people,  I'm nothing more than a ""subhuman, deviant, satanic, degenerate, pervert who is a threat to all kids and to all families"". I've heard and seen that almost every day since I was 14. So wtf does it matter what kind of a career I have? Wtf does it matter of I do good in this world and want a public service career? Wtf does it matter if I have a degree or am fit and healthy or whatever tf? It doesn't matter at all because I'll always be nothing more than all those things to society. I'll always be alone, I'll always be an abomination and subhuman. Nothing will fix that, except opting out.",depraved_saint2294,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuxd7m/im_a_subhuman_nothing_more/
My Story,"My whole life, I always got along with teachers and adults better than people my age, but I did still have a large number of friends. When I was 8, my parents told me I had a brother, but he died 19 days after he was born to the same heart condition I have .. thinking little of it, I told my friends and one by one I started losing friends, turns out my friends didn't want to risk doing stuff with me since they didn't know what to do if something happened.

After that I was embarrassed by it so I hid the fact I have heart problems. I then went to college where I met a girl I dated for 6 months, unfortunately she was killed by a drunk driver when she was pulling out of the parking light (he ran a red) .. the damage was insane to both cars, but the drunk driver got out with a few scratches. Unfortunately, my girlfriend passed away in route to the hospital ... this threw me in a dark depression ...

8 years later, I finally got a great job doing what I liked .. all was good until my heart problems came back, then I was removed from our after-hours support for two years, which my job was fine with ... Eventually, I got demoted, but no pay dock, which made me even more depressed. Eventually, I had a heart attack at work and was taken to the hospital. When I returned, I was placed on administrative leaves; a month longer, I got fired because two of my FLMA forums were signed by my doctors they required one to be a hospital doctor.

Depressed I lost my $50 /hr job I got more depressed then my job lied so I couldn't get unemployment so I hired a lawyer whom contested the decision and I won so I got back paid for that but still depressed and felt like a burden and lost everything.

I was thinking of suicide because none of my family supported me just demanded I get a new job ... so I went outside one night and prayed that someone in this world needed me that I wasn't just another number.

Two days latet one of my friends messaged me on facebook she wanted to catch up on things. At the time she had a daughter 25, a son 13, after talking about stuff I moved in with her ... it didn't take long for her son and I to become best friends since I worked on computers and he was interested in.

The first year was good, I enjoyed volunteering for the fire department but since day 1 my friends parents didn't like me so they wrote bad letters complainimg about untrue things that got me let go fr the fire dept however her son and I begain thinking of me as a brother so did I and that was when I learned that part of my heart that was destroyed by drs who killed my actual brother felt like it was being fixed. I was happy ... The starting of a new year now meant I spent 1 year there, that is when things changed ... When he hit 14 he started arguing about dumb things and it only got worse. The new year was horrable; we had a bad house fire, and my friends parents that leasted her house were being annoying getting the things revuilt so I spent $500 setting up a custom outside shower with a tankless heater ... overall lots of bad things happened but I countered then so no one would stress .. 

During the same year I was suing my employer so that meant telling everyone about my heart condition I just felt like each time I told the story, I wanted to just die ... Eventually, they settled and all was good.

Shortly after that, my friend got a boyfriend, but the guy was awesome. he liked me and everything .. Well, a few days ago, I found out her mother was kicking us out .. The problem was none of us had anywhere else to go ... her son quickly liked the guy she was dating, which eventually started feeling he was distancing from me since he didn't need me, not sure, but he claimed he wasn't  ... But what hit me was he was looking at houses which didn't include anything about me going with them if they got a new house .. This devistated me since I contributed a lot but kept my cool.

See my parents often said my real brother should have lived instead of me, which hurt me a lot as all I wanted was to give someone all the opportunities I never got, and it did for a while ...  the past few days, my friends son has just attitude with me, only does things that benefit him, and now I started to see I was losing him as a brother. ... and I can't start over .. my health is failing quickly. I have 4 cardiologists and my doctor constantly arguing over my meds, so its a mess ..

I finally broke down a few nights ago .. my friends son went from being caring to just do whatever I don't care mode .. then I started thinking, and I included my friend in my will so that she will get all my insurance money, which meant they wouldn't be homeless, which made me feel good ... but here lately I feel like a burden like they don't like me and it tore me up so I've been thinking it could be my final gift to them since I am about to lose everythig ... I feel like I was a horrible brother and that my parents were right no one would ever love me because I was broken...

As of now idk what to do .. I broke down and started taking anti depression pills because I want to be happy I want things to be ok but as of 6 doing nothing, but I am scared of dying alone but scared that the one person I trust as a brother no longer cares and everything I tried to get him back to failed so when we get kicked out I'll be living in my truck I guess ... but I know that if I am going to do something, the time is now since I am on medical leave and have been since I started my new job 2 years ago ...

I feel like the past years were wasted I fesl like I lost everything so I stopped taking my blood pressure pills hoing maybe I'll go to sleep and not wake up that way my friend gets the insurance policy so she can take of her family since I don't feel like I am part of it or even needed anymore ..
 I feel like I failed and suicide is the only thing to make everyone  happy, and the depression I have is changing me from fighting to stay alive to just giving up... soo I am looking for support ...",Kleinsachi,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuon0k/my_story/

Lost / Bored,"Won’t go to much into detail but I feel lost at this current moment in time.

Here is my current situation:
Second year college student, graduating next year with a bachelors. I don’t struggle in school, I do very well given the amount of time I allocate to it everyday. Poor. School work from 9AM - 8/9PM. Away from home, friends, and any form of comfort. Ik I need to get out of my comfort zone to grow, but damn.

Extra: I am truly blessed, I have a great family who cares and financial backing for college (Just enough to survive). My parents give everything to make sure I am comfortable and have the opportunity succeed in life. It makes me so unbelievably pissed off at myself that I can’t be happy with that. It’s so selfish… 

Things I am struggling with:
1. Can’t explore my hobbies/passions because they cost money and I’m a poor college student who has obligations to uphold before anything else. To be specific, I really enjoy cars.

2. Find myself not enjoying things I used to do. Playing video games have become somewhat boring and trivial. I love playing on my computer and laughing with friends but we all have different games and times to play now. 

3. Had to stop smoking weed a while ago. Found myself clinging to it because it gave me an escape from reality. Love it and all it does; it helped with anxiety, somewhat depression, and genetic tremors. Used it while playing video games and hanging out with friends. Only took 2-4 small hits off a pen a night; only used it after 8/9 when I got all my school work done. 

4. With a girl who treats me well but shit at the same time. I believe she loves me but uses me at the same time to do her dirty work. She deals with mental issues and I’m not necessarily, in my current mindset, the right person to bear her rants and destructive behavior. I am very horny, but she doesn’t like to do anything sexually, she just likes to hang out and fuck with my head. She’s a good person with ambition; I wouldn’t be where I am today without her. I feel like I owe her.  

Conclusion: I know my situation is quite pathetic and I should be better; I am trying my best. However, I struggle to find happiness with the hours I have at the end of my daily routine. I feel as if I’m working towards a goal (Get a job, make money) in which end I will find happiness. I don’t know if I’m telling myself a lie or if I actually believe it. I don’t enjoy talking to people, I prefer to be by myself. At the end of the day, I have the resolve that happiness is not required in life. I just need to keep moving forward. Just look at my old man lmao.

Please leave any comments, good or bad. I’m not easily agitated or hurt. Constructive criticism is needed for development. Plus what do I know, what do you know? We are all wrong. Anyways, I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this and/or comment. It means a lot. Most of your who find this are probably in a similar situation anyways. -Best

Depression is a thief.,"Hi all. I'm 45, mother of grown children. I have had depression since my late teens, I'm heavily medicated and take zopiclone every night after coming off quetiapine for 15 years.

I'm still here, still battling the darkness, only thanks to my children, but I believe that with strength and courage we can all fight this lonely battle.

I have no friends, no relationship, no family, I feel isolated and lonely, I'm not sure why I was born to just live like this... But I'm still here.

I see many posts of people saying they want to die, I used to feel that all the time but then I realized that I don't really want to die, I just want my depression to end. I want to feel happiness, I want to experience excitement etc.

Depression is an awful, grueling mental illness but please don't choose suicide ☹️ I am random stranger on the internet but I really do care if you're here or not because I share your struggles.

Venting,"Always
Feel exhausted every single day, most days I feel like I work my butt off and my roommate is juts so fucking lazy it drives me insane. I try to work as much overtime as I can and she juts quit her job because she couldn’t handle it which is not the first time this is happened with her. Sometimes I juts feel so tired and annoyed by her. 
We both struggle with depression and anxiety and I know it can difficult but I feel like I have this weight on my self every day that I feel more and more tired. 
We DoorDash a lot to make extra money and I’m always the one that has to do all the work and go inside and leave it at the door while she drives. Which is lot the biggest deal but when I feel like I’m too tried to go inside or move she makes a big deal and acts so passive when I ask if it’s okay not go inside and says the most passive aggressive statement like “I guess”. I juts feel like I’m always judged or put down by her for anything that I do even the skit simplest things like how I leave the wallet in a car. I always have to be reminded that I should t do things a certain way or that I’m not paying attention. Maybe this is never the intention but sometimes it feels like incredibly frustrating. I feel like I’m always judged all the time. She sleeps all day does nothing and then when o try and take sometime to relax and nap she’s always waking me and it’s so annoying. She always smokes all the weed and I’m just so tried. At times I wish I could just leave but I have no where to go.

It's like all the fun in the world just faded out. Music doesn't sound the same, gaming feels like a chore, and i can barely muster up any motivation for much else. All i derive pleasure from is either fast food or porn, and both end with me feeling like trash inside. So i really have nothing left to do. 

I feel so tired and so washed out its hard to believe I'm not in my 60's. I got so tired that i took a visit to a psychiatrist, foolishly hoping that maybe i can be saved by a pill or two. 3 months of celexa citalopram and i feel the same as before, i guess not even serotonin can give me the feeling of happiness that i keep dreaming of.

very low self-esteem,"So I have depression and severe anxiety, and recently my self-esteem has been at an all time low. I feel so ugly that sometimes the thought of going outside and being seen by others is genuinely intimidating and it’s easier to just stay at home and isolate myself. Whenever I am out in public, I wear a mask as often as possible so I can hide my face, and it takes me so long to decide what I want to wear because I don’t want to show my body at all. 
It has gotten so bad recently that I’ve actually started to feel bad for other people for having to look at me? Which I’m aware sounds so ridiculous and crazy, but I genuinely feel like I’m so ugly I’m a burden on the people around me and I feel bad that they have be around me and see me. 
I have never been in a serious relationship and have rarely had anyone express any interest in me, which seems to confirm my fears that I’m too hideous to be seen. When I am interested in someone, I get very depressed because I assume they could never be interested in me and I never tell them in fear of making them feel uncomfortable (to have someone to ugly be interested in them - again, I feel I would be a burden). 
I realise all of this sounds like I’m being dramatic or crazy, and I know rationally none of this is true or reasonable, but it is genuinely how I feel about myself. I also realise that external beauty isn’t important and it’s what inside that counts and whatever but I just want to feel pretty once in my life, and it is making me so depressed and isolated and just exhausted.

I have no reason to live. Would it be right to kill myself?,"Hi. I'm 13 years old. I guess you can call me JD. I'd prefer to keep my name private and recently I've been in love with Heathers (The movie and musical) so I guess I'll just work off of that. I haven't really had much will to live these past few years. I've been really depressed since I was ten. Really only had random spurs of happiness throughout it all. My mom left me when I was younger. My dad's come in and out of my life but I'm pretty sure I don't have to see him ever again. He's a drug addict and he kinda always despised me. He used me to get close to my grandmother for drug money. I live with my grandmother and her boyfriend. They aren't abusive. But I don't really like them and they don't really like me. The only person I like is my girlfriend. At school I'm a dick to everyone so they'll leave me alone. She broke past those walls though. She's kind of an outcast. She has many friends but they're the geeky kids. She doesn't really have any popularity. But none of that matters to me. I love her. She's the sweetest person I'll ever meet. She's had a few struggles with self harm that I've gotten her through. She's gone through cutting but I was able to help her go sober. She has been for a few months now. She always feels lonely but I try to help her. She's 13 as well. Her 12 year old brother throws her around like a ragdoll, but other than that she has a good family. They despise me. But everyone does, so it's nothing new. She has a lot. She has a ton of the newest shit, some of the coolest art skills ever, and she aspires to succeed at everything she does. Then there's me. I lay around and cry every day. I have no will to do anything.  She still somehow loves me. I just don't really think she needs me. She's so perfect and so active in her life. I just want to see her happier with someone else. I know she would be happier without me. She tries to help me sometimes but I just push it all away. I've dealt with cutting myself for a few years now. Since I was 11. This has developed into a masochism type deal. She helps me with this a lot. We're only 13 but she has cut me before. She's also beaten, choked, suffocated, and kicked me a lot. It was all asked for tho. We both like it. She gets to relieve stress and I get my stress relieved. But still I know she'd be happier with someone normal. I've got a few screws loose, I know that. I've enjoyed mangling road kill beyond it's already flattened state and I've loved looking at real gore. Crime scene photos of blown open skulls. Anyways, I just don't feel I have purpose.

Sexually deprived and frustrated to the point I don’t want to live,"22m. I’m a fairly handsome guy, 5’11. I have hobbies and I love going out. Yet I’m still a virgin and it’s completely destroying me at this point. I have getting dates and I usually have fun, still nothing. I’ve had opportunities in the past but my lack of social skills/understanding back then caused me to miss out. At this point I’m deeply depressed, suicidal, and hurt. My self confidence has tanked and I know you shouldn’t let others determine your self worth, and I take care of myself pretty well, but literally I’ve never been with anyone. It’d be different if I’ve had a few in the past but that isn’t the case. I’m angry as hell to the point where I could toss the chair in my therapy class out of the window.

Cannot act out my fantasies or have any sex with someone I want. No I am not going to settle, I’d rather shoot myself in the face then settle for less than what I want. I know no woman owes me sex or anything so I have no anger towards them. I just want to learn how to please a woman correctly and learn her anatomy, meanwhile I get to have some fun out of it. I want to be able to fuck a woman correctly and please her as best as possible. I feel like everything is a lost cause, I’m still trying to develop my social skills, as I had bad social anxiety throughout my childhood so I missed out on developing these skills.

I wasn't special.,"This is a vent, as so many things here are. So y'know, I'm not in danger, can't seek help because negative money, bla bla.

&amp;#x200B;

My whole life is in shambles now, and I don't know how to cope with anything. I'm an adult with no adult skills, and I can't seem to learn them no matter how hard I try. I started too late- my brain has gone solid, even the smallest changes of habits feel like impossible goals. All that is a usual story, though. The thing that bothers me is knowing that I tried to fix it when I was younger.

I think I knew back then there was something wrong with me, I couldn't focus and I couldn't accept things, couldn't think about the future, couldn't think about myself. I never had any thoughts of growing up- I lived entirely in the now. I was ephemeral and weird and had odd focuses, and I was deeply depressed and dissociated from reality. I struggled with the most important things, but no matter what, whenever I asked adults for help, without fail- they told me it was okay and that I was special.

Don't worry about it! You're so intelligent! You're just different from others- special, smart, and bright. An indigo child who needs to be allowed to run wild and free. I had good ideas and was existential for my age, and because of that every adult in my world decided that I did not need help. They were so consumed with the idea of allowing me to blossom into some wild perfect unique flower that they didn't notice the weeds tangling through my roots. Some kind of parasitic vine that looks just like the rest of me but is slowly draining my life force, year by year.

No one wanted to medicate me, for fear of altering my natural state. No one bothered with therapy because I was too clever for therapists to break my walls down and they interpreted it as me not needing help. No one thought I'd struggle, because they all assumed it was the big bad world getting me down- bullies, politics, social stresses.

In truth, none of that ever really bothered me. I didn't care about bullies, because I was too busy hating myself. Now that I'm an adult, I can't ask for any help and I have less than nothing to my name. Sometimes I struggle to believe I'm a real person, and not an empty shell walking around pretending. My friends and family look at me with so much hurt and pity- like I'm dying in front of them and they can't do anything about it. But I'm not dying- not really. Just failing to live.

I wish I could tell them it's their fault. I know it really isn't, because they were trying not to hurt me the way their parents hurt them. They did their absolute best, and I was a weak seed. I just wish there was something I could do, someone to blame other than cruel fate. I wish I had more strength to try harder, I wish I had more ideas on how to change my life, I wish for just one day I felt like I could handle even the smallest task.

I really wish that nobody ever thought I was special.",Crus0etheClown,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuof69/i_wasnt_special/

Is it Mirtazapine or Vistaril?,"I would get little sleep for weeks at a time. 

I am moving out of my parents house in the next month, I am also looking for a job to make good pay. And trying to look for a college. So as you can tell, my stress and anxiety is really high. The anxiety has led lack of sleep, leading to depression, leading to suicidal thoughts. Recently my therapist recommended an SNRI and vistraril. I gave the recommendation to my physician. My physician prescribed 30mg Mirtazapine and 25mg Vistaril. 

3 days in and the effects from this have been great. I sleep 30 mins into taking the Mirtazapine, and take the Vistaril every 12 hours. My sleep is solid and feels natural. I get 6-10 hours a night and wake up feeling a little drowsy but good. My anxiety has significantly decreased as well. I’ll feel tiny jumps in my body from usual things but it all feels minimized. 

Other things I’ve noticed and what I’m curious about. 
Before these medications. I would go to the gym, take pre workout, feel great during the burn, feel the caffeine from the pre workout, and feel good about myself overall afterwards. I would also jerk off once maybe twice a day. 

Now whenever I go to the gym, I feel drowsy working out, no rewarding feeling at all. I try hard to discipline myself and stick through it. For some reason, I can’t get into it like I used too. I even take the pre workout, nothing. I don’t feel the caffeine, or the surge of energy to get through it. I also don’t really get erections anymore. Like if I’m out and about. And see a female that turns me on, I don’t get hard anymore. The only way I can is if I purposely look at porn. Don’t get me wrong either my overall sense of well-being has improved, but my motivation has dropped to the floor

This kind of worries me as I have never suffered from a suppressed sex drive before, and don’t want to lose my gym gains. I don’t understand this.

I have absolutely 0 self confidence because realistically I’m a very unattractive person and I would have to be completely delusional to think I’m not. I can’t take pictures or buy new clothing without wanting to cry from my looks. 

I have no financial freedom or any kind of freedom so I’m stuck living with my abusive and insanely controlling parents because school takes up every last bit of my time. 

I get good grades but I’m not the smartest and classmates that I know personally are all are doing so much better than me. They’re all doing research, are club leaders or working medical field jobs already due to their connections while I have nothing. All I get is denied denied denied while they can simply just ask daddy or mommy for doctor shadowing and a job. 

I have no friends. Not a single one except my boyfriend which I don’t even like anymore and has caused me so many trust issues but I just don’t want to be alone. I’ve tried talking to people in person and online but nobody seems to like me.

How can I stop self harming?,"(I posted this on the advice sub as well, so the wording may seem strange)

When I feel extremely depressed or upset over an event, usually something that would warrant a moderate amount of disappointment or sadness, I’ll strangle myself with a belt (hoping to die). 

I loop it around my neck and slam the door on the other end, and keep leaning over. I have yet to lose consciousness over this, but I have had ringing ears, dizziness, and, of course, neck pain. 

I’m not sure how concerning me doing this is, but I know it’s not good and I want to stop doing this every time something happens. The next day I usually feel completely normal and realize how I had overreacted, or I feel generally better. 

In the moment it feels like the only option, and that there’s no hope. I doubt a Reddit reply could completely rid of this problem, but if there’s any advice I would appreciate it.

I feel weak for still caring,"Why is it that even when someone hurts me I still care? Is it because it takes a lot for me to open up? Because I seal myself off so tight from everyone. When I finally let someone in and they hurt me it feels like every fear I had was correct.
Yet like a moron I still hope they are doing well even years after they hurt me. Sometimes I even just want to talk to them but I know it would not end well.

Who's in the wrong here me or the psychiatrist?,"I got diagnosed with clinical depression about 3 or 4 years ago, have been through a doctor, camhs case worker and 3 or 4 psychiatrists who have all agreed upon this. Recently i have been switched to yet another new psychiatrist who i had a phone appointment with about 40 minutes long. He decided to take me off venlafaxine (which i dont rlly mind because it hadn't done anything for me) but the plan from my last psychiatrist was to increase the dose so as to get the snri effects rather than just the ssri (i have gone through sertraline and fluoxetine already with no difference seen). This seemed odd. He also told me to just stop taking them (cold turkey) the next day which considering venlafaxine has some of the worst withdrawals of antidepressants is odd again. I am tapering myself off. He is prescribing me mirtazapine 15mg. From what I can tell 15mg won't rlly have any antidepressant effects and sorta strikes me as though it might be a 'sugar pills' sort of thing?

Anyway near the end of the 40 minute conversation he just slides in that 'he doesn't think i am clinically depressed but just have a few of the symptoms'. Not only do i feel like i have almost all the symptoms but how can he decide this from a 40 minute phone conversation, not having seen me in person and having had about 6 medical workers all having agreed upon this before. He gave no indication of an alternative mental health issue and i just generally got the sense he thought it might just be like a teen phase sorta thing? (i am fairly recently 18). Its rlly getting to my head and making me doubt my diagnosis which i already had thoughts (like many mentally ill people i think) about whether i was just idk lazy and unmotivated etc and not rlly mentally ill. It's just getting to me uno considering how much ive struggled daily for the past 6 or so years. Am i even mentally ill. If i'm not than i have got to be one of the most useless humans that has ever been created.

Idk, Am I overreacting? Is the psychiatrist in the wrong? any opinions on the situation welcome

Withdrawal,"Hello dear friends

It’s me again, still trying to get off paroxetine - now on 10mg dose alternate days

I endured so much misery to get that off my system but currently I just can’t. My anxiety just came back so hard that I’m writing this feeling every literal pulse in my body, constant squeezing chest pain, constant diarrhoea, nausea, heartburn, tremors etc

I could really manage somehow with all the other withdrawal shit but this level of anxiety is knocking me out of breath. 

I booked an appointment with my GP that’s happening within a week, to maybe adjust doses or add another SSRI ? I don’t know

Please guys if anyone went through sth similar I’d be very grateful if they would give me insight

My cats are why I dont unalive myself,"Every time I have the thought of ""I wish I had a gun"" or ""I hope this weed (legal where I live) kills me tonight"" (even though I dont take nearly enough for that) the one thing that pops in my head is their little faces. The thought of leaving them like that always makes me cry and I get rid of those thoughts quickly.

My family would be sad and I think my boyfriend and his family would be too but its always the thought of my cats that brings me back. They both came at a time when I really needed them.

One I found as an orphaned (I found the mothers body. There was one other kitten who unfortunately didn't make it) 2 week old kitten. I was planning on offing myself sometime that week but I ended up finding her instead. After that I became too busy with trying to make sure she lived to think of me dying. Ive had her for 6 years now.

The other came to us a little over 3 years ago. She's more my boyfriend's cat but she cuddles with me sometimes when I'm particularly down. Honestly she just showed up one day and she was already fully grown by that time but she was so sweet. I was again planning on offing myself when she showed up. She was rubbing up against the legs of me and my boyfriend and being so cute and sweet. It was raining really hard and I suggested we bring her in for the night. It was obvious she was a stray by how dirty and thin she was but we asked around just in case. Maybe she was someone's farm cat. No one claimed her or knew anyone that she might have belonged too and we've had her ever since.

I dont know if there is a God but I have been somewhat of a practicing pagan for 10 years who ironically has a couple of statuettes of Bastet. Im not going to claim she physically exists because lets be honest. No one knows that until they die but if she does exist in some form I feel like she's looking out for me.",renthecat25,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tumf0y/my_cats_are_why_i_dont_unalive_myself/
just feel so lost with no good place to start,"I (24 M) don't really know what I'm doing with my life. I really just want someone to listen for a moment. It seems like every time I plan something out with the intent of making my life better I lack the willpower to follow through.

I work a dead end job with insane hours for next to no pay. I live with my dad. I have no idea how I'm going to move out because I can't seem to save any money, and I have no real marketable skills to speak of that would make me an appealing match to any well paying jobs.

I lack the energy to take care of my spaces. My car is filled with garbage and miscellany. My desk is surrounded by food waste, boxes, junk mail, and random junk. My bedroom is full of old pop cans and more junk mail. I haven't put up my laundry in two years at least, it just sits clean in my hamper, and my dirty clothes are piled on the floor of my closet.

My hygiene isn't fantastic, I just let my hair grow to where it wants to be and I don't clean it up. I do shower regularly, but I don't brush my teeth, and the only reason I do that much is because my desire to not be greasy overcomes my lack of energy towards staying clean. Self care is another thing I just don't do well. I don't eat regularly and when I do I overeat. I don't sleep much but I often take multiple naps throughout the day. It isn't restful. I got myself a gym membership in January, but since February 1 I have visited once and couldn't even work out for 20 minutes.

I have considered therapy but at this stage I don't think I can afford it. I don't have anyone I wish to reach out to and vent, even. My dad knows I'm depressed, although I think he wishes he could forget about it and just call me lazy. I can't talk to him about my issues, as he's probably the leading cause of most of it. Thankfully, he doesn't ask how I'm doing because I don't think I could lie.

But nobody else asks either. Other people seem to superficially care, but nobody wants to help me help myself. Family just seems concerned and I'm not sure how my friends are. I doubt some of my friends even consider that I might be struggling. I seem to be the sounding board for their problems. Other friends, I just don't want to burden with the immense weight of my trauma. In any case, nobody except me really knows how bad I have it.

Honestly I want some social interaction, too, but I no longer have local friends and I don't enjoy time with my family. My two best friends live about 1500mi/2400km away. I want to move out to live with them, as I know it's a much healthier environment for me to be in. Honestly, I just want to be held but they're the only people I know who would be willing.

I don't really know that I had a point in writing all of this except to explain how I'm existing with my depression. I'm not really succeeding but I am surviving, and despite feeling like I'm not good for much I don't want to end it all.

"March...Right, its April now, but what happened to March?","Some days I sleep so less that I wake up questioning whether I even slept, not because I feel so very tired which I do, but because I wake up feeling so disoriented that I honestly don't know whether or not I've slept because all I can remember is being awake or waking up continuously. 

Then there are days where I'm sleeping too much and its not good quality sleep either. I keep waking up, but and then falling right back to sleep because my eyelids are just so heavy. On days like these, I can sleep anywhere from 12 hours to 18 hours, which means I'm awake at maximum only a couple hours. And on these days, like the days when I'm not sleeping enough, I'd wake up disoriented, only the difference is, instead of waking up questioning whether I ever slept, I'd wake up questioning whether I'm really awake or is this also a dream. 

So honestly, its now that I haven't tried. I need to have the energy to move to eat, but if all im doing is continuously sleeping or not sleeping at all, how in the world are you expecting me to have enough energy to eat? I'm a full-time student, a college junior, on top of that. I have midterms, homework, quizzes, lectures, and labs. They all require attention and time. Yet on top of my hectic sleep cycle, I've been having persistent migraines for over 2 weeks. Im taking all the meds as instructed, even the rescue, even the steroids, in fact, I've finished all of my steroids, and nothing works. The migraines are there every day when I wake up and when still there when I'm falling asleep. How am I to function? I can barely sleep, my migraines are consistent and unrelieved, im barely eating enough, im tired all the time, and I'm highly stressed by school. And there's also the family issues that comes up every once in a while as if there was someone counting and keeping track. And I have health issues. I have past traumas that I haven't had time to deal with. So tell me, what am I supposed to do? Am I not already trying my best? I still make sure I eat everyday tho perhaps not as much as I should. I still attend lectures and do homework. What needs to be taken cared of, I take care of. But I don't know why I have to live like this. It's not that I don't recognize that this is a problem and my priorities are off, but its not like I haven't tried. I tired. But when nothing you do changes anything, you learn ultimately that you can only just accept it. So all I've been doing is pushing myself harder and harder each day. I feel like a car that has been running continuously on the highways without a break, occasionally I may even need to accelerate. My gas runs low and I fill it up just enough to not stop running, but never a full tank. And the times when I take a break are the times when I'm filling up the gas, which is barely any time at all. And before I realized, I'm back on the road, driving, heading to a destination that I don't know. All I know is that I'm expected to drive, so I do. But honestly, I don't know how much longer I can last. I'm trying my best. I really am. I doing everything I'm told to. I'm not completing them well, but I'm doing them. I don't know. I don't know anymore. Why I'm typing this? What am I trying to get at? I don't know. I just don't. I'm sorry, I really don't know why. Or perhaps, I do.

Suddenly hyper sensitive to orgasms during a wave of depression,"

So about 2 weeks ago I guess I kinda had a mental breakdown from constant anxiety over the past couple on months, and went into a really bad depression phase.

Right around this time I noticed my penis is a lot more sensitive when masturbating.

I know this sounds like a troll but it's not, but basically it pulses a lot harder and longer and there's a much stronger stream of ejaculate.

Before it'd pulse and be over in around like 5-10 seconds. But now it feels like it lasts for like 30 seconds and I could go longer but I'm scared of over doing it.

Could this be related to the depression?",cumcuncumcumcumcum,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuu2vu/suddenly_hyper_sensitive_to_orgasms_during_a_wave/
Told I’m ‘draining’.,"Told I’m ‘draining’. So I have suffered depression for over 20 years ( I’m 39 now). It’s always been up and down, however past year or so it’s been a lot more erratic. I can be so happy and joyous and then just crash, then happy again then major crash. Or I can go weeks in the lowest mood and can barely move but still go on for the sake of my family. I have lost any friends that I had, possibly from the result of self medicating with drink. I feel incredibly lonely despite having the best children in the world who I love at a level where there are no words. I have a husband who can be supportive and loving or nasty and uses my weaknesses as ammunition to put me down. I have a home, we have money but nothing makes me happy. Everything is a temporary high to fill the void of deep emptiness and loneliness and feeling of rejection by everyone. I find it incredibly hard to make any friends at this age as everyone is busy with their lives and aren’t looking for new friends. And I have tried. I feel like such a fkin saddo- I really do. It’s embarrassing not having any friends and I can’t help but think it’s a reflection on my personality too. Do I appear desperate? I probably do. Someone told me that my depression is draining and they just want positivity in their life. Sums it up really.

Flopping between extremes and worried I'm becoming dangerous,"So I'm a BPD sufferer in a really deep hole at the moment. I've come back into the country since living abroad to find my support network is no longer available to me. I don't have any friends at the moment and really struggling to meet anyone.

My mental health has been rapidly declining since getting back. I'm at a point where 70% of the time I'm extremely depressed. The other 15% of the time I'm in deep suicidal spirals where everyone I have ever known hates me, nobody cares about me etc. I act accordingly by lashing out obviously. I'm not violent but lately these have gotten to the point where I've caused arguments and not just between me and people, I've brought my whole house down... Again this isn't behaviour anyone has ever seen from me before.

My last 15% is spent in borderline euphoric happiness (it feels like MDMA lite - genuinely like I've taken something with all the effects. Colours like brighter, sensations feel better, everything. But I find myself extremely difficult to control in this state and become unaware of any potential consequences that I'm compelled to do. This behaviour people are more familiar with but I've always known the time and the place and now I just don't and the euphoria is new.

I have a lot of trouble snapping out of either of these states and they're both extremely dangerous states of mind. I don't even recognise I was doing it until afterwards sometimes. Does anyone have any coping methods I can do to both, prevent these states of mind and how to quickly recognise and return to baseline when I'm in them (As I work 13 hour days so often these are at work in a noisy factory where sitting down meditation isn't an option).

Notes:I'm in therapy, but due to the public sector being overwhelmed playing catch up from covid, I sometimes go 3 weeks without contact so reliance isn't an option.

Best way to stop relying on others as distraction?,"So I've recently, with the help of a friend, come to realise that I've been using the presence of others to talk to as a distraction from depression. I had a tough start to the year and I thought that I was coming out of it in the past few weeks, but I've realised now that I've been relying on talking to friends to distract myself from it. I noticed that when I have nobody to talk to for extended periods of time that I've felt my depression coming back seemingly out of nowhere. At first I thought it was because I missed the person I was talking to, but it seems that it's not necessarily the person or people that I am attached to and miss, but rather the distraction they provide. The same friend that helped me realise this said I need to work on self validation and learning to rely on myself rather than others, but I really don't know where to begin with that.

It was all good until 5th grade. I was stupid, idiot, impulsive and maybe did a few cringey stuff looking back, yet scored good marks (because it was all my mother could care about throughout my academic life). But I didn't give a damn as a kid, because I didn't know how to


And my social life PEAKED at that time..


I'd never felt out of the place. I had a cool bicycle that I used to ride to race with my neighbour down the street and back up. Many friends in my building, many friends in the school before most of us grew apart. Some of them are even raising their kids currently.


Albeit gradually, I'd become very, very shy! So naturally any activities that required forming groups proactively went out the fken door. 
 

So wherever I try to gather some courage, I am always worried that I'll do or say something that will catch my social ineptitude. I don't leave remembering impressions on people. So can't really say I BELONG anywhere.


The more uncomfortable I feel going out, the greater the chances I will avoid going out next time. And this has gotten so much worse to the point that I've fallen into abysmal depression and stress and severe anxiety. 


At work, or in my local community, or at places of worship, or talking to mid-aged men, talking to teenagers these days, I've always felt like an outsider. A powerless coward HIKIKOMORI who's too unhealthy physically and mentally. No wonder I feel like my life is in shambles most of the time.


In poor country like mine, I could understand when someone would say ""you can't afford to be depressed, man up."" People feel they need to be hustling all the time, to prove they are _someone._ 


I'm not the kind of person who can pretend that I've got all my shit together. I CAN'T INDUCE TRUST FOR MYSELF IN OTHERS. 


Now my apathy has taken over my conscious mind. So even after knowing the way to Improvement, I have little to no willpower left.


I'm waiting for a terminal disease to take me off the face of the Earth and in process my family could be benefited of my life insurance money.

I don‘t know how to keep going,"I‘ve been depressed for about ten years, I don‘t remember what not being depressed feels like. My childhood was horrible; I had a physical handicap, I was bullied and I was abused by the two people I loved most. I don‘t think my abusers had any malintent but it left me emotionally scarred. 

My depression has worsened again over the last few months. Most days I don‘t even manage to shower or brush my teeth anymore. Everything that‘s supposed to be trivial somehow has gotten extremely challenging and overwhelming. 

I don‘t have a real job, don‘t have ambitions, don’t have a hobby i regularly pursue nor do i have a will to live. However I have many wonderful friends and i love them dearly, they are the only reason why I‘m still alive but I‘m not even certain if most of my friends like me. 

I‘m lonely, I‘m tired and I need help. The last few months have been really bad and I don‘t know what to do or how I‘m going to survive if it doesn‘t get better soon. I know I‘m pathetic but I can‘t take it anymore and I need help.

My dad keeps telling me that I'm lazy,"Every saturday, my dad comes home from work and the only thing he notices is how messy the house is. 

For reference, I am an only child and my mom is dead. I am the only one left at home most of the week and I work from home from morning to afternoon. I am also trying to get myself healthier by going to the gym. 

My thing is, I don't know if I am really that lazy or is my dad making me feel like I am. I know damn well that I am doing my best juggling everything on my hands. I provide food for us and I also pay the bills. 

I hate when my dad belittles my job just because he thinks I am doing nothing at home when in fact I am in front of my computer screen from 6am to 6pm doing work. He always tells me to find another job as if finding jobs right now is not difficult. 

I'm sorry if I am ranting right now but I feel like I am doing everything to keep myself and my family afloat yet my efforts are being disregarded as if I am a lazy piece of shit doing literally nothing at home.

Having trouble keeping my “happy” face on.,"I (40m) have had bouts of depression since I was a teenager. 95% of the time no one can tell and the rest of the time I can play it off as not getting enough sleep or blaming it on my allergies. But for the last 2 weeks I can’t seem to put my fake smile on. 

I woke up hysterically crying just now and just told my spouse I had a nightmare that I can’t remember. I’m hoping crying it out in my sleep allowed me to shed some of my built up stress and depression so I can make it through today. I’m in HR and I’m supposed to go into work today on my day off to set up a going away party for one of our associates who was just promoted and is being transferred and I don’t even want to get out of bed. I know I’m not going to look “ok” and am really not in the mood to have anyone ask me if I’m ok. I’m not but there’s nothing they can do or say to help so I’ll just blame it on my allergies today.

Medication Resistant Depression/ I'm desperate for relief and don't know what to do.,"This is my first post here and honestly I kind of skimmed the rules, so I truly hope I'm not doing anything wrong here, but I think it's probably fine. 

Has anyone been told by their psych that they have medication resistant chronic depression? I was always a fairly normal kid despite my physically, emotionally and sexually abusive household. In my late teens/early 20's is when the real depression hit. I somehow made it out of my rut and had a pretty decent life until about 23. I was very social and had tons of friends and functional romantic relationships. I finally got a job that would help me kickstart my career as an engineer(I didn't go to college so I knew I had to work hard). It soon became my sole focus to work on my career. All of my friends didn't seem to be as serious about ""growing up"" as I was. Because of this, I ended up becoming very self-isolated. I'm 30 now and have my dream job. I got exactly what I worked so hard for. However, I've been extremely depressed for half a decade. I have no friends, no family and only keep to myself. I cannot remember the last time I had a genuine smile. I'm completely miserable every day and have absolutely no desire to do anything. I can barely do the bare minimum like go to work and pay bills. I can't even be bothered to clean my apartment, it's honestly a mess. I just have no motivation to do anything about it because every night I go to sleep, I'm hoping I won't wake up. Suicidal ideation isn't new to me and is an every day occurrence, though I don't think I would ever actually go through with it. I've seen several professionals, have tried pretty much every medication out there and NOTHING WORKS! I have no desire to talk to anyone, meet new people, take care of myself like shower or brush my teeth, etc... I truly don't know what to do at this point. Even doctors are telling me they can't help me. Therapy works a little, but only during the session and 10 minutes after I go back to feeling the same way. I'm overly aware of my negative thought patterns, but I can't do anything about it. I've been trying for years and I'm just so worn out...

&amp;#x200B;

I became an alcoholic about 2 and a half years ago. Booze got me through the day. Last year, I finally went to rehab for a month. I did good for a while(about 4 months). I eventually fell off the wagon again because being sober just made my depression more unbearable....so I still drink. I know it's bad, and I've contemplated going back to rehab, but I know I'll just get clean for a bit, then depression would just take over my life again. I don't want to make a huge point about my alcoholism as it's a SYMPTOM of my depression as it didn't come until much later.

&amp;#x200B;

If medication doesn't help and therapy doesn't help, what else is there? My depression has consistently gotten worse as I've gotten earlier and I can only imagining the trend to continue. I can only think of a few memories in my entire life where I wasn't completely miserable. I'm just over 1/3rd of my life and I'm miserable. I'm desperate to try something to help, but I feel like I've tried everything.",sauteedjellyfish,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/turf5y/medication_resistant_depression_im_desperate_for/

Think I'm getting a depression,"So I've [M21] broken up with my 4y relation with my gf[F22] 6 months ago. Since then I started meeting a lot of new people and actually made a lot of friends. In university I joined the students association and I think I could say I'm popular in the department. Everybody knows me and a lot of people say hi to me everyday(some people I don't even know). I'm not handsome or anything, I am just a bit crazy and have this weird ideas and I think that's why people like me. I talk a lot and to everybody. So, since my relationship was over my life seems to have gotten better but I've never felt so alone in my life. When I'm not with someone I just want to cry and when I'm with anyone I feel like I'm just faking it. I can't really feel good anywhere anymore. I feel myself trapped inside my body and sometimes at night I can't sleep and start crying and shaking and punching or kicking the blankets. The worst part of it is that I know why this is happening to me and I even know that I have every reason not to be like this but I just can't forget her. She was all that I ever wanted and now I'm afraid I may not ever find someone I love or someone that loves me and being forever alone. This fear of being forever alone or never find someone to connect with is killing me. I had never had this urge to give love to someone and I just can't hold it anymore. I feel rejected by everyone and even by myself and just don't know what to do anymore or how to carry on with my life. Everything seems so pointless...

I’ve lost all interest in my hobbies and don’t know what to do….,"Hi there;
I (19M) have been going through a few struggles recently and I’m not sure where to turn to. I enrolled myself into therapy Thursday and I start in 2 weeks. In the meantime I figured I’d put how I feel on here. 

I guess I’ll start with my condition. I was born with an incredibly rare benign brain tumor that sits in my pituitary gland and it’s been known to cause behavioral issues, and mental health issues. I’ve always struggled with just talking to anybody and expressing emotions through words (social anxiety?). It’s gotten so bad that it was one of the reasons that my past relationship ended. 

Now onto my living situation. I live with my parents still because housing where I live is outrageous compared to how much I’m making. My mom has always looked down on me compared to my other siblings (4 older sisters and a younger brother); people I’ve talked to about it compare it to middle child syndrome. One of the reasons I believe she looks down on me is because I’m a carbon copy of my dad who she’s not too big a fan of. He died a while back and things just haven’t been the same for me since then. I can’t get a car or a license because of the seizures I have so I’m pretty much forced to have her shuttle me back and forth until the seizures subside a bit (work is less than 15 minutes from where we live). But yeah; in the past there’s been a lot of emotional abuse and manipulation. She convinced my brother and I when we were younger that my dad just didn’t want anything to do with us; when, upon further investigation from my older sister who lived with him before he died revealed that he had tried to do things with us and paid child support on time and she just flat out refused to let him see us. Which just fucked me up because I very rarely saw him since he was living out of state. 


Next is the situation with my ex and I. I met this girl last year and we clicked instantly. We both had a lot in common and quickly became bf and gf. This girl never had to pay for any dates…. I payed for everything we did together, I paid to put gas in her car, the whole nine yards. We dated for 11 months; then one night she brought up the idea of having an open relationship with another guy because I wasn’t meeting her needs apparently; to which I opposed of course. We got into a massive argument and I assumed we broke up because of the texts she was sending me making it out to seem like she was no longer interested in dating anymore. I had bought tickets to an event she had been dying to go to as a surprise for our 1 year anniversary (Which was 3 weeks away at the time); so after we had “broke up”, I had posted on my instagram story that I was officially single again and that I was selling the tickets that I had bought. Well, apparently we didn’t break up and she got pissed that I put that on me story. That completely broke me. Quite literally. I didn’t feel anything at first but guilt but as I started going through the days, I started getting more and more upset about it. Now it’s all hit me at once and it sucks. 

In the middle of all of this, I started a new job. It was perfectly fine at first. Very typical job, training me on the easiest section first and leaving it at that. Well then my second week came around. The absolute hardest and busiest section in our department they threw me on by myself and left me to figure it out without any prior training. The entire time I was being yelled at by furious customers because I was taking too long; regardless of me being the only person on that section. This went on for 4 days. I can’t even talk to my department manager about it because she runs off and I have no clue where she is. 

Between the emotional stress of work and my recent breakup, I’ve lost all interest in my own hobbies. I’m over eating like a mf and some days I barely have enough energy to get out of bed. Almost like it’s a chore to even get up and do simple things anymore. I’m not sure if this has something to do with what I’m going through, if I’m burnt out, or what it is. I don’t mean for this to be a “feel bad for me” post and I apologize if that’s how it comes across I just don’t know where else to turn to until I start therapy. But any help or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",Super-Job1226,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tur3m9/ive_lost_all_interest_in_my_hobbies_and_dont_know/

A kid keeps talking to me and it makes me uncomfortable,"I don't know where to turn so I figured I would just write it here:

TLDR - I have a teenage boy texting me alot and I am a 30 year old man. We have nothing in common and I don't really want to be talking to a child. I am not sure how I can have him stop talking to me without being rude.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday, I was playing Elden Ring when I heard some commotion outside. I saw a teenage girl start kicking the tree in front of my place. 

So I go out there and try to see what is going on. 

I found out from the teenage girl that her phone was stolen by some guys in a SUV. I also find out that her teenage brother was threaten to be kidnapped by the guy. I have cameras around the place so I promised to try and give them the footage I have. I tried getting the mom's number but she seemed to not speak English, so I got the teenage brother's number. 

I send over the footage to them and the brother starts asking for things I can't do. I just assumed he was upset over everything that happened to him so I tried to be reasonable about it. I gave him footage of the guy, the suv and how it looks. He asked for the license plate and I said my cameras didn't catch there plates. He kept asking for it even though I said I didn't have it. 

He then said the police were planning on coming which was fine because I gave him all the footage I had. I figured the police wouldn't need anything from me because I gave him everything I had so there would be no difference. Instead, he kept telling me to go there place to show the police the same footage I already gave them; but I figured again he was just upset about everything that happened so I decided to go over and talk to the police. The police said they think that the bad guys weren't trying to kidnap the teenage boy, but instead they wanted his chain. They believe this because the footage doesn't really have clear audio since the incident happened some feet away from my house. However the video shows the SUV go up to the boy and they ask him something, then the boy runs away but drops his sister's phone in the process.

After that happens, I go back to my house to try and relax after what happened and play elden ring. A couple of minutes later the boy texts me again. He says that they called his sister's number and the bad guys picked up. **They want ME to go there with is mom (who only speaks spanish) to try and get the phone back and to take photos of there car. He kept bothering me about this and I told I didn't want to do it but he kept bothering me about it.** 

He eventually said that his parents were going to get his sister a new phone and that they weren't going to meet the bad guys; which I believe is a good idea. I thought that would have been over but the teenage boy still wanted me to go out and try to see if I can find there SUV. 

He even bothered me this morning about it. He also keeps texting me asking me what I doing today, its kinda too far. 

I don't have any way to contact his parents. I already have a lot of mental stress and don't talk to people, let along kids. I think that is highly inappropriate.

I wanted to post something positive here.,"So I’ve posted stuff about suicidal thoughts before. It recently got so bad that I cut my wrist and was admitted to a psych ward for a short period. Since then I’ve been trying to hold it together.  I have suffered from depression and suicidal thoughts for many years with things peaking in the last couple of years. More recently I was able to return to work, and also have been upping my therapy session and my antidepressant dosage was increased. I’ve also managed to get to the gym twice a week for a few weeks and am losing weight. I’m still struggling but I feel hopeful for the first time in years. I hope maybe this can give someone else hope that maybe there can be some light at the end of the tunnel.

I can't seem to move beyond my past, all the times I have hurt people and all the friendships I have let wither and die. Even when I'm not doing as poorly mood-wise, I still don't talk to anyone.

I don't really know anymore,Im 21/M and very open about how I feel and can be very blunt with saying I feel I need mental help. I been living with my mom for the past 4 to 5 months after my ex and me split up. I tried to get my life together again by getting a job and trying to move on and do something with my life. But if I'm honest I haven't been having the motivation and reasoning to keep it up I just been burning my bridges and burying my self in to reckless stuff and getting myself back on doing lines and smoking outa the pipe. I haven't been wanting to do anything I try to go outside but I start to get hella anxious and start to sweat and get jumpy I don't know what wrong with me I just know I need some kind of help. And I ask all the time but I'm met with distance and just being rolled over. Like I understand I am 21 I need to go out and get a life a wife a job a stable place in this world but I can't get it together I just wanna make the voices and the paranoia and memories to stop. I have already accepted death 3 times I'm my life and the calming and sweet sensation of just thinking and feeling like it's coming made me feel so relaxed. I don't know what to do I feel like I lived a good full life I was engaged to a beautiful woman for 6 years and that went to shii. I was making almost a grand a week when I was in construction then that went to shii too. I use to be able to buy and get whatever I wanted or needed. But that was lost due to my stupidity and missing my ex and getting deep into depression and turning to substance abuse started with heroin and then max then ice . Now I dont know if I lost my mind or what's happening I'm not scared or worried the craziest thing is in a Christan and love the Lord with my whole heart and I know he knows everything and had my life planned out way before I was even a thought. So why would he allow me to feel this way I know we have freedom to choose but I just need someone to help me I'm sorry if I'm to much I just thought if anyone I would have my family behind me but my sister and aunt and mom just tell me it's all good don't worry or just nod and just bring something else up im just feeling like that old saying I guess will see if care if I'm dead I was never silent about how I am feeling I'm over holding it in.

Having depression has made me a worse person.,"Due to living with depression from a young age, I've learned to navigate life in the wrong way. I lie all the time. Lying has always been my way out of stressful situations in life. School, friendships, work, family, you name it. If I've interacted with you, there's a 9/10 chance that I have lied to you. At first, I did it to cover up my few self-harm scars, and my mental shutdowns, then I began to use it as a crutch. Sometimes I think about how scary it is when I lie so effortlessly. I feel I wish I could say that I never mean to lie but that would be another one of my lies. I know that underneath all my lies, I'm nothing.

I got into a beautiful relationship that lasted from 15-19 and I feel like we only broke up because I hit a wall of depression. I was depressed because me and my girl had our own place but had to move out and she went back to her parents and I rented a room. she wasn't allowed over much and I just fell into a routine of working everyday and laying in bed waiting for work. 

I am now 23 and have my own car and apartment but I feel so damn lonely. I worked hard for this stuff to enjoy it with her. I haven't moved on but I did plenty of drinking and drugs to numb myself. I don't want to keep numbing myself and I been doing opioids and damn has my life fallen off. even had a 2 friends die from it, but one was a really close friend. everything feels so quiet and depressing without these people in my life. it's like every chance possible life removes these sources of light from my life.

I want to escape reality permanently,"(**I posted this as a comment on a subreddit I'm a part of, but decided to post it here to see if anyone else feels this way**)

I just want to escape reality permanently. Reality is full of work, hardship, interpersonal drama, fights, and all other manner of shit.

I'd rather live in a perfect world that's a fantasy then a shitty world that's real.

Sometimes, I just lay in my bed and daydream about a better world to live in. Sometimes, I'm a kid again, and I'm playing my Gamecube for hours in my old home. Other times, I'm the last person on earth, and I just explore the world undisturbed. Other times, I dream it's Christmas, and my whole family is getting along.

That's why sleeping is the highlight of my day. I get to dream and for a moment, I forget what's real and what isn't. I get to truly believe my life is good for a moment, and that everything is okay.

I wish I could just save up money, get put into a pod, and just pay to be put into a dream world of my choosing. I don't care about whether something is real or not anymore. I just want to be happy.

I don't want to spend the rest of my life in this miserable reality.",Larynx15,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tufwn6/i_want_to_escape_reality_permanently/

Unemployed College Student. All I do is nap.,"I feel like such a bum. I’m 19F, I don’t even have my license. I have my permit. But I’m scared of driving. Scared of going that extra step.

I don’t have a job. The thought of getting a job makes me freeze up, panic. Want to throw up. I feel as though I’m lost. Unprepared for the realities of adulthood. I want to curl up and cry. And sleep.

I live at home as a “full-time student,” and I can’t pursue my doctorate because we’re poor, and there are little to no scholarships for doctorates.

I just feel so lost. One of my best friends moved across the country to California, and she’s forgetting me. She asks that we play games less and less. My other close friend is both a college student and works. I feel so useless and lazy in comparison.

My boyfriend tells me I’m pretty, but I feel like I’m not. 

I nap. A lot. Sometimes just existing is tiring. I feel myself getting bad, mentally. The pandemic has made it so much easier to isolate myself. I’m in counseling, but I feel guilty for that, because my mother wanted me to go to this one specific counselor, and so she pays $100 every session. I’m medicated. Have been since grade school.",goddesslucy3,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttwovy/unemployed_college_student_all_i_do_is_nap/

21. Psychotic depression ages 11-14 was never treated. What are the long term effects?,"Hi, I am 21 years old and have struggled with major depressive disorder off and on, mostly on for the past 10 years. I had psychosis for 3 years but it was never caught, and both that and my depression went untreated for those years. Now I am on a low amount of medication and although I am still depressed, I can function well enough without it. During episodes I will quit activities I’m serious about, stop moving as much, isolate, have intrusive self harm thoughts, sometimes lose my hair, stop hygiene, etc., but I do the minimum so I don’t fail those around me. My current job is my sister’s attendant and that’s flexible. Does untreated psychotic depression have permanent effects? Am I still suffering the after effects, and if so, can I fix it now?

"F/30 soon 31, heartbroken 3 times and currently unemployed","These past 5 years of my life have been a shitshow. I was married in 2019 to a guy that after getting drunk at a wedding, he started yelling at me, throwing stuff all over our hotel room and almost hit me. He apologized but later yelled at me in front if his mom so I asked for divorce. He immediately monkeybranched to a 22y old coworker in less than a month. I wanted him to apologize, but he took another route.

I was devastated and took a year to ever consider dating. I finally met a guy I liked from another country and we had some fantastic 4 dates with sex in all of them, and I thought It was gonna be my happy ever after, it was all amazing but a day before our 5th date he said he didn’t have feelings for me and he felt that wouldn’t change in the future. It has been horrible trying to move on after that. I feel like I cannot trust my instincts and I wouldn’t endure another heartbreak.


My mom died in august, probably too soon, but I don’t feel sad about it because I spent enough time with her…still I had to spend time with my very sad dad.

While I was abroad last year I was told by my manager that my paycheck would be reduced due to the pandemic (I was a digital nomad) and so I started having problems with housing, I got super stressed and sad about my divorce and I started crying on a train station and someone called the police and I was forced to get into an ambulance, then the hospital decided to leave me on a psychiatric ward. I thought they would let me leave after 2 days or a week but I spent almost 3 months there and they communicated with my parents telling them I was doing weird stuff. 

I got forced at the ward to take clonazepam which I hate because I feel no effect and also gets me constipated and look bloated, which worsens my self esteem…and when I returned with my parents they forced me to keep taking it. After my mom died my family stopped forcing me the clonazepam which I am glad. It’s so sad it took something like that to stop them.

I still don’t like anybody and I feel as If I am not enjoying living at all. 

I will be 31 soon and I see my friends from high school getting pregnant, celebrating anniversaries and I just feel life shouldn’t be like I am living. 

I obviously don’t share what I am feeling with anyone because I fear they will put me on a psych ward again. 

I still wake up, shower, cook, clean and work out and sometimes play videogames but I am so nauseated about my love/dating situation since I am not even a good partner because I am unemployed. 

I have been trying to get a job abroad because I don’t enjoy working here in my country anymore, but it has been difficult to get something else (I have been trying since January)

I don’t leave just because I still have family and I know they would be devastated, but I am simply not enjoying life…

I HAVE to do it.. eventually,"Hi, so I am 18 years old and currently attending college. I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was about 12 years old. They never seem to completely go away. I’m on 40mg of Prozac. In my teen years I was in CPS from 15 until I turned 18. I was sexually abused at 13,14, and 15. Anyways this doesn’t matter. I’ve also kinda attempted suicide. But anyways at least once a month or so I break down crying and resorting back to wanting to end my life. Of course right now I’m currently stressed with college, trying to find a place to live, find a job, and much more but at the end of the day I feel like what is the point. I look up to people who found the strength to end their own lives, I’m terrified and I’m lazy. I just want it over with. Last night I had a dream about some stranger ending their own life and as they were dying I begged and pleaded for them to help me end my own life. My jealously was so strong because I wanted to be them so bad. I’ve been thinking about this dream all day. Anyways, I just want to do it so so bad. It’s my goal in life. No matter where I am, I am never happy. People point it out to, I try so hard but I’m never satisfied or content in the moment. I know I have a long life ahead of me but I seriously have no goals at all in life besides ending my life. I always vision myself to be dead. I get asked what I want to major in college but I picked general studies just so I can seem like I’m productive and wanting a future. If I could be anywhere in this world, even the most beautiful and amazing places, I don’t want to go because I’ll only enjoy it for a little bit but my mind will turn back to darkness. I love reading, writing, listening to music, but I don’t do it often. It’s boring. I’m tired of eating, sleeping, showering, going to school, and simply just waking up and breathing. I personally believe life is just not for me. I love and appreciate the people I know and the people who care about me but they will be okay. I know it will hurt them so so bad once I end my life, but I have to do this.

Fuck this," 

For most of my life, I've always just wanted to die I didn't care for a future or any plans it's already a struggle just to try and live. I always told myself maybe it'll get better so I just ignore those thoughts and just go along with life but after my dad caught a stroke we've been more financially unstable and I began to break more and more I stopped going to college without explaining anything to anyone, but I was forced to again the next few semesters and I failed 4 semesters in a row so I got kicked out.

I tried to kill myself back in October I drank a shit ton of alcohol and some antidepressants, at that moment I think I remember vomiting and as I blackout I felt a huge sense of relief I thought it was all over but I woke up at a hospital then was bought to a psychiatric ward shortly after, I felt so frustrated and guilty for all the money I wasted and for living and having to continue living.

I got a little better as months go by but I knew this was just pretty pointless, I will never escape this hell that is living. I enrolled in a new college this February I hated every second of it but I did every requirement attended every class and did group work. It all felt so pointless and empty but I know living in a 3rd world country without a degree is not really good. All my siblings already graduated and have moved on with their lives.

Now I'm here, no dream no plan no motivation no will to live. I don't want anything or anyone in life I'm just done. I never wanted this life I might try and end it all again",Isolateddark,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tujzhf/fuck_this/

How I feel on most days.,"The guilt is all-consuming. I feel guilty for merely existing, it is the kind of guilt that only makes sense when you live with depression, it feels primal and as primary to my being as every individual cell in my body. I carry it with me everywhere I go, but unlike a normal physical load, where your body develops muscle over time and you’re finally able to carry it around with ease, you’re building nothing. It feels as heavy today as it did five years ago, in fact, it feels like you’re deteriorating because of it. With this guilt comes shame, as if I have taken the place of another, who chould have lived my life and perhaps lived it better, with a clear purpose and less wasteful of their time here. It feels like I have robbed the world of one who could have contributed far more to it than I ever could, I feel like a place-holder, sitting in a chair never meant for me. It feels like nature made a mistake, like an existential error, a miscalculation on God’s part. A blemish on the face of the earth corrupting what little patch of land I happen to occupy at any given time. I hate feeling terrible but feel terrible about feeling good. Perhaps this is why I sabotage any opportunity I get at being happy, why I ruin everything I touch and appear to be hesitant about pursuing friendships and relationships that add value to my life. A part of me feels like this constant self-flagellation is akin to getting justice for all the sperm-cells I beat in my very first competition, as an unconscious biological speck compelled only by sheer duty. Perhaps this is me getting justice for all the ones who could have taken my place on this world should say, my mother had miscarried me and had another child afterwards, should my father have not taken any liking to my mother at all and eliminating the idea of my conception altogether. ",Lopsided-Worker761,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuf8xx/how_i_feel_on_most_days/

At what point do I need to call a health care professional?,"My fiance has major depressive disorder. And she is dealing with a lot of childhood trauma. She has told me she thinks about killing herself. She has told me this more than once. It scares the shit out of me and she doesn't want me to talk or ask for help. But I'm scared she is going to hurt herself and I am not equipped to help her by myself. I am not a healthcare professional and I flat out do not know what I am doing. I've tried to talk to her about getting help, but it always ends in her saying I don't know what I'm talking about (which is true). She refuses to set up an appointment with her therapist and I've been trying to get her to go back for well over a year. Everytime I bring it up, she gets furious with me. I've offered to pay for her therapy. She'll get moments of clarity, but during this clarity she still does not seek out help. She quite her job 2 months ago, which was a huge stressor for her. I saw huge improvements mentally from her, and I was hoping she was taking steps in the right direction. She had another breakdown last night. I've been working particularly long hours these past two weeks, and I have not been able to give her as much attention. When she gets like this, I truly fear for her safety. I am starting to recognize PTSD symptoms in myself when she gets like this. I start to walk around on egg shells whenever I detect she is minorly upset. I know that's selfish, but I am trying to explain that I am not mentally or professionally prepared to handle what she is going through. I feel she needs professional help, but I don't know how to get it to her. I've offered to get her on my insurance and pay for her, but she would ""rather die alone then do that now"". Just two days ago she was talking how she was so happy with me. 

I desperately need advice on how to help her. And I need to get her that help before she goes into another downward spiral. I don't have the tools to help her when she gets in that state - she doesn't have any local friends, and her family are all POS and won't help. What can I do to help her? How do I convince her to set a therapy session up. Next time she gets like that, do I need to take her somewhere? Right now she wants to leave and go ""somewhere"" that is not near me. She has no money, no job, and is about to lose insurance. She has no other support. She ""will not put herself in a position where she can not support herself"" by marrying me. And she tells me I lack empathy for not being able to help. It's not that I lack empathy, it's that I am not equipped to help her. I am not a mental health professional. I do not know what I am doing. And to make things harder, she starts attacking my personal character when she gets like that. Starts to play at heart strings I get weekly therapy for (The kind of heart strings I've spent years of therapy to get through). And by the end of the night, she finally goes to sleep, and I am left in a ball shaking in fear and depression myself.

Please, does anybody have any advice for me. I am to scared to leave her a lone. I'm scared to try and talk to her about getting help in case I trigger her. And I'm scared she is going to leave me like she said and actually go hurt herself.",Ok_Ocelot_5530,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuijre/at_what_point_do_i_need_to_call_a_health_care/
"First new severe depression episode in over a year, it just suckssssssss","Sorry I just wanna say this somewhere, it’s probably gonna read really disorganized, well that’s my brain right now. Like a flickering lightbulb on its way to burning out. I don’t tell people in my life about my depression, my boyfriend even I only tell the most basic things, I’m just not comfortable talking about it. Actually I physically can’t lol, whenever I start to I just cry and then I don’t stop crying until I stop trying to talk about it, not very productive.

I’ve been severely depressed all my life, I know how it goes. I can live with the fact that I will never not be depressed, whatever. I’ve learned to cope with the baseline depression, I have a pretty normal life.

But last week a new episode started and it’s extra extra bad. Not like I want to die bad (yet??? Who knows! Tune in next time to see if shit gets worse. For legal reasons that’s a joke), but like why do I exist bad. Fine line haha… I think it was initially triggered at least in part by a setback in the weather. We had some almost 70°, sunny days, and then immediately the next week it dropped back down to 20s and teens, snowing, sleeting, wind whipping, dark overcast days on end. 

I couldn’t get out of bed the last four days, actually five days now, or more, I lost track. I’m so grateful my boyfriend brought me some takeout and I’ve been eating that all week, I don’t remember if I ate yesterday though actually, oops. One takeout box I would usually eat the whole thing in one day, it’s lasted me 5 “meals.”

I can’t get any work done, I can’t even do the typical tune it out tactic of putting on a show, I can’t focus on any show I switch them all after like 15 min of an episode. I can’t get into anything right now. 

I don’t want to talk to anyone, my boyfriend got me out of the house to attend a play that our friend was starring in, we had intended to go for months before so I felt guilty if I didn’t support him. We went with some of his other friends, which for some reason gave me a lot of social anxiety, which I haven’t had in a few years either. And I know these people, it was very strange. And frustrating, I hate anxiety more than depression because anxiety is like a “positive” feeling, whereas depression you feel nothing or sad, anxiety you actively feel like, well anxiety, you know how it is. 

I’m just like when will this end? But I know it might not anytime soon, and that’s also frustrating and discouraging. It could end tomorrow, it could end 3 years from now, who knows? Not me! I was hoping it would be a one day thing. Then it turned into two, then three, then four, then five, etc. I can’t pretend to have a cold for much longer.

I even tried doing some online shopping, nope, I don’t care about anything right now. My birthday is in a few days and my mom usually sends me some money but I don’t even care about what I would spend it on because there’s nothing I want.

I have so many hobbies. Painting, block printing, embroidery, tattoos, cooking, baking, doing my nails. But I don’t want to do any of those things right now. I just don’t care about them

I’m not inspired to cook, not that I have an appetite to eat anyways, the most I’ve done for myself is move the water pitcher, the French press full of coffee, a bottle of Tylenol, my water kettle, and tea box over to my nightstand… so I can lay in bed all day and be a potato and watch the hours pass. I want to cry but I can’t. I want to do something but I can’t.

At least I get out of bed to go to the bathroom? But then it’s right back to bed for me. The other day I folded three pairs of pants and that just killed my energy. Some other time before I went to the kitchen to make coffee and I did manage to do it, but I ended up sitting on the kitchen floor just staring at the fridge for probably over an hour before I could get back up again.

Today I got dressed at least, I’m hoping I’ll get some burst of motivation to maybe put socks on next. Then shoes. Then go outside maybe. Probably not though. 

I think my goal for today, or should I say what’s left of today, should be to take out the trash, and eat at least one piece of bread, and… well I did manage to take a shower yesterday for the first time in a week so at least I already accomplished that. Everything is just so hard and my body feels like it weighs a ton, so does my heart. It’s exhausting.

How are you all doing? Hopefully not too terribly. Thanks for reading if you did, if not I understand, who wants to read about some random girl on the internet’s problems lol. I hope you feel better soon, we’re in this together. 

Um if you can offer any, I would appreciate some kind words, I feel like a little child that needs to be praised for doing the smallest thing right now, it’s quite embarrassing actually. I’m glad I live alone at least so no one can see how ridiculous I’m acting. And if you can spare it, any advice or suggestions for something that can get me off my ass. I’m just totally blanking on ideas right now, even the advice I usually give to other people, it’s just fallen out of my head.

I've attempted suicide again after 2 years,For about the last 8 months I haven't been suicidal or depressed at all I thought i was over depression. Within the first week in January I had my first lsd trip and from there I fell in love with it and revisited mushrooms. I love both of them so much and have had only 1 bad acid trip but I quickly recovered from it. I tripped on mushrooms Tuesday and it wasn't nothing too crazy. I just felt extremely happy and content with life and loved everyone and everything. But the day after i woke up and decided to skip school. I noticed I felt genuinely happy even though I hadn't taken anything. I got ready for work and after I got to work it felt like everything fell apart. It was insanely busy and the kitchen crew wasn't doing what they were supposed to and one customer was getting in my face and I just walked away. I was so angry but we made it through and I clocked out. On the drive home I was feeling happy listening to music. When I got home it felt like my parents didn't like me. I tried talking to my mom about my day but my dad came into the kitchen and was being annoying and lightly slapping her face. I could tell she didn't like it and said something smart assy to him. I he said something back and continued bothering her and she became visibly frustrated with him. And I didn't know whether I should intervene. If I did I know it would probably get physical as I already don't like him. I ended up saying something again and he got mad at me so I got up went to my room packed a bag of water and got my keys and left. I was gonna go blow off steam by skating but my mom blew up my phone saying my dad said I need to get back there now. I turned the car around and went home. He ended up dropping me off with my mom at my brother's jiu jitsu class and I sat in the car feeling frustrated with the day. I got home and went to my room and cried because I had no one I could talk to. No one I could talk to my feelings about. No one to take me seriously. I felt so overwhelmed with negative feelings I decided to overdose on benadryl. I grabbed the bottle went to my room and downed between 30 or 35 pills and let them kick in. I felt the come up and had an anxiety attack because I realized I didn't wanna die I wasn't ready. But I just went calm and accepted it because I did it to myself and it's what I deserve. From then on I don't remember much I just remember my body felt good but my mind didn't. I kept blacking out and I remember trying to get up and knocking things over and I thought I really died because I was standing and reaching out for things and leaning forward but my hand never made contact so I thought I was a ghost. When I woke up the next morning I saw I posted something about it and my friends were messaging me and I was responding weirdly and got on a call with a few of them but I don't remember any of it. I felt so embarrassed the next day (thursday) I couldn't look any of them in the face and felt like everyone was judging me. I also felt really sick which didn't help. I decided I'm probably not killing myself until before my 18th birthday. I still feel very overwhelmed especially at night which sucks because I just want to grab the bottle and try again. I'm not sure the point of this. It kinda feels good to write it out.,IncidentRealistic888,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tu8z6j/ive_attempted_suicide_again_after_2_years/
Gaslighting,"
“You should be happy” 

…is gaslighting. It’s a lie.



Maybe I’m just genuinely not fucking happy with my life no matter how much you try to convince me that it’s great. Im not you. 


Your happiness might be completely against what society says it is and you’re just going to have to endure the ridicule to get out of this mess. 


Maybe this will help, or not. I just figured out that nothing was wrong with me and I actually just hated my reality. Hence depression. 


I’m thinking about saving from work and then selling everything to get a travel van and live that way. I’m getting so much shit for un-conforming.

My parents called me a piece of shit,"So i had a discussion with my parents about my mental health and they said I am an arrogant, ungrateful child with no life experince and that i know nothing about life. They said that it's just a phase and there are people with worse problems than mine, invalidating all my feelings. The last thing they said was that i am a lazy piece of shit who does nothing all day and is a disappointment who only thinks about self-harming.

They said they would kick me out of the house the moment i reach 18 years.

I am very heavily considering suicide and i have no clue what to do.

Edit:Thank you all so much for the support. I saw some people say to call the CPS but i don't think i have the courage to do so.

I've lost everything and I can't take it anymore,"In the past few months I've had people who thought had the potential to become good friends have fucked around with my feelings building up my hopes only to cut me loose. In one case she was all over me then out of the blue fucking ghosts me. This led to 4 days in hospital 2 of them in the icu, 5 days in a mental ward a month in rehab and now after being fucked around again I'm back in rehab. 

All my hopes for connection are gone. Even my drinking buddies are leaving me soon. I'm gonna be on my own. I can't stop self harming I've even cut my hideous face because making it more ugly won't make much of a difference.

trash,"i don't know how to love. what i have to give is not love. maybe it once was, or could've been. but now, you just get the leftover scraps of what i managed to keep for myself. halving those is unappreciated, i don't blame anyone, it's hard to even notice you are receiving anything. my attempts are therefore equivalent to throwing half of what little i have out the door, for no reason. i don't get it. i'm just very dumb and spent what i had wrongly. a big risk taker is me, and they haven't paid off. and now, i'm a freak. heaven and hell, sweet poison. a person trying to run away from themselves, whichever self it is that they feel at a given moment. wrong things with calls to stop, and right things with suppressing mantras to grow. i don't know where it comes from, but when alone, thinking nice or happy towards those i feel i shouldn't, i get opposing vivid imagery in my head. gruesome endings to myself, not in motion, just the aftermath of me there in my final state. it's stark, and like a flash. a deep wish to close and never open. a subconscious desperation to prevent me from doing what leads me to pain. it only comes when i don't believe anything nice i do could be wanted or liked, and i'm back at that stage. do not worry, it's familiar and survivable. i wouldn't let you in even if you wished to help. nobody touches my core, and when they disrespect my line after clear unambiguous warning, a knife to the throat in self defence seems like a reasonable way to make one understand if words they don't respect. express permission is required. don't mistake my selflessness as boundless. i protect and hide the minimum i can. i don't want to hide anything, but i must, because a life of being open and honest makes me vulnerable to lasting pain from the smallest of things. your handful of words could be life-changing, and i fear the echoing days where being repeatedly beaten into a lesser-self is each day's itinerary. i've gone through it enough. full stimulation ending with a out would be blissful. weightlessness, altered mental state, music so in your head you don't know where it's coming from, and something to blow my mind. end me on that note, and to those that'd shed a tear, you never understood me. but alas, that'd be a problem for the living. erased would be i, welcoming whatever the play may be. water doesn't flow upstream, and that i take to heart, so let me enjoy the meanderings of the current as it swirls down to the drainage system to carry away the used. what a dramatic bit of text. and for what? a temporary expunging of my dismal thoughts and the ecstasy of dreaming of solutions to problems beyond my capability. if this world operated on the principle of voluntarism, maybe i'd wanna stick around more. in a way, it is how the world works, because we always choose to avoid the harm we are threatened with by those who protect us from ourselves. i'd rather die than perpetuate this sickness which i and you are victim of. what a shitty homogenised and domesticated, hollowed-out and spent species. try saying no and sticking to it. retract back into the hole whence you came.",ruined_and_dreamless,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tuhwqe/trash/
"I don't know, I just want something.","It's going to be a long post, I talk too much when given the opportunity, I apologize in advance if I end up rambling too much.

I don't recommend reading this, I feel a little disgusted, there's probably a lot of people here that are on much more pain than I am, and I think that some things I think and feel will not be liked by most people, but I think that if I am not honest I will not be able to find the solution. I want to make this post to seek help, but also to free myself.

I'm an attractive guy, I guess. I've never had a problem making friends, and people tend to like me. I'm also smart, I think. I am interesting/deep too I believe, I don't know if this will be understood, but I have always felt that most people live on completely different planes, I speak, and they answer, but I rarely feel that I am understood. Or maybe I'm just a guy who thinks he's special, I don't know. I also have a girlfriend who makes me feel loved, a brother with whom I get along great, and who understands me well, and a mother who loves me very much. In addition to all this, I am also very introverted, I am nice, but usually I do not socialize.

If I had to summarize myself, I would do it like this: A random guy who doesn't leave the house, kind, honest, and goes unnoticed.

I guess this is the background I wanted to give, I don't know if it helps to understand something, but I don't lose anything I guess.

What I'm going to do now will be difficult, and I'm sorry if you don't understand, but I don't usually open up, and I don't usually make contact with my emotions, not because I repress them, but because my personality is like that I guess. Actually, I think I repress them, but deep inside I don't want you to tell me not to.

I guess now the post actually starts; I feel lost. I have many things, I have always been told that I should value what I have, and it is something that I praise myself, because it makes sense. But it feels fake. I feel bad. I've been skipping class for 6 months, in a couple of months classes will be over, and I'm still the same failure I've always been but somehow have managed to hide, I'll have to start again next year, and I'll probably miss too. I want to be what they want me to be, I know it's wrong to live to others expectations, but I want to live up to it, I don't like to cry, and I'm doing it. At least I feel something, I guess. I want to feel something. What I'm saying doesn't even make sense. Why do I feel alone if I have everything I have? Why can't I go to class? Why I don't talk more to people? I want friends, but when I have them I just don't value it enough, I don't nurture relationships. I miss when I was a child and I spent my days playing Castle Crashers with my brother and my cousin, I miss not having a conscience as developed as I have now, I liked those times better, I didn't think about me, I didn't even know what self-esteem was. Nowadays, I spend 8 hours a day playing video games, I usually enjoy it, but in the last few years it feels like I'm doing it to avoid my reality. In fact, that is what I am doing. I feel bad. Why don't I value what I have? I want a goal, a purpose, everyone says they have one, why don't I want anything? I end up settling for anything. There may be some things in my life I may not like, like my lack of will, but it's like there's nothing ""I don't like"" enough. I don't want anything, I'm like a dog, I move by inertia. I think I speak badly to myself sometimes, but it doesn't to be the problem because I'm usually fine, or at least that's what I make myself believe. Deep down I know that nobody can help me, because I don't even understand myself, I have made this paragraph opening my heart and when I read it I don't like it, because it doesn't make sense. I can't expect people to guess how I feel. Sorry. I do not know what I want. It hurts to carry the pain all day, at least I'm good at hiding it, not from others, but from myself. Most of the time I spend daydreaming, because my fantasy life is better than the real world. I don't know what to do, I want to sleep for a long time, but I've been having insomnia these last months. I want something more, I demand that life gives me something more, is this fair? How can I take more responsibilities? How can I make me want to take them? How can I want something? I don't like that the only way I force myself to do things is when someone has expectations of me, I don't like failing others, but why do I constantly fail myself. I've told myself a thousand times to go back to class, but I can't, or I don't want to, I honestly don't know anymore. I could go to the psychologist, but I don't want to, I don't know why, I don't like to go out, I want to be at home. I'm fine here. I'm not, I'm tired. If I am as intelligent as I have always been told I am, why, even knowing the consequences that will happen as a result of my present actions, do I keep watching my life go by? Why do I feel like a spectator of my life? I hate that every 6 months this happens to me, usually I'm fine, I don't think too much about anything, but then out of nowhere this stone falls on me, and I feel like I can't move on. I suppose that with time it will pass, but while I am living it, it becomes unbearable, I want to be well, although being sad is not so bad. Feeling such strong emotions is interesting, I suppose. I want to go back to class, I want to be someone, I want not to feel alone... Where do I start? Does anybody care?

I need some help to keep going… I’m about to end my life soon.,"I (19M) have been depressed since I was 16 years old. I want to kill myself but I can’t find a painless way to go through with it. I really don’t want to hang myself but I will if I have to. I hate myself and my life.

I live at home and I would ask my parents for some help but my mom has 4 younger children to take care of and my adopted father never has enough time for me. I don’t have a reliable support system. 

My parents have abused me and have made it clear that I’m not good enough for anything. They constantly shame me into thinking I don’t deserve good things. Instead of cheering me on when I’m down, they push me down when already down and trying to get back up. 

I’m a socially awkward introvert who hasn’t had a girlfriend since high school. Not to mention I dropped out and got my GED so I have the stigma of a “high school dropout” 

I want to make new friends and meet new people but I self sabotage every opportunity that presents itself. Like today, I was supposed to have a job interview but I didn’t show up. It got in my head too much. My mom shamed me for that one big time. I hate myself even more today because I just feel like a useless man to society.

My mother sent me to a sort of exorcist,"I have dissociation disorder (+ a severe depression) and my main problem about that is the child who takes my body and does what he wants, he sometimes comes in my head and I dislike it. My mother believes in things like energy or cosmology but she's still a little sceptic. Personally I don't believe in this type of things at all. 
So we went to this man, who does a sort of exorcism and he said the child in my head disappears but I disagree.

I want to support my friend but don't know how.,"tl;dr Friends got addictions &amp; I want to help but don't know how. 

My friend recently started drinking alcohol &amp; smoking, I don't know what else, were 15 btw. I think this might be because his brother, who he was close to, committed suicide around 6 months ago, and his parents aren't at all close to him, neither do they know about this as far as I can tell, but I don't get to talk to them almost ever so I don't know.

He also has started casting aside his more supportive friend group which I am apart of. while drunk last night he kept on messaging our snapchat group saying that we were a boring friend group, I'm not sure if that was just banter or not. The friend group which he was apart of (which includes me and 5 others + a couple less close ones) doesn't approve of what he's doing, and 70% of them say they don't want to get involved or do anything, and another one of us thinks that he should stop casting us aside and refuses to support him unless he is also starts supporting our friend group which I think is dumb. This specific friend has also had mental health issues which I helped him our with, if its important, you can see more about him in a couple of my previous posts asking for help with how to support him which I have now got sorted.

I think that's all, but I'll add to this post if I think of more, please ask questions in comments if that helps and ill try and answer them as truthfully as possible. I just need help supporting him because I don't know what to do.

"After almost a year of feeling like my depression was under control, I’ve gone back to my worst. Please help.","I don’t know what’s going on and I just need some advice. 

Early last year I was diagnosed with severe anxiety, severe depression and PSTD. 

I was in a constant state of panic that I can’t exactly describe. I felt trapped in my body. I was crying constantly. Sometimes I scared myself bc I’d reach a point where  I was insanely sewar-cidal and I’d be freaking out that I’d do it. I was just ready to be done. I’d wake up and the first thing I’d do is cry. I was beyond miserable. 

I was prescribed different medications and finally felt amazing on 20mg of Lexapro. I’ve been on this dose and medicine since March of last year. Ive felt normal and enjoyed life and was just super content. 

Until… literally this week. 

A very minor thing happened recently, and it’s like it flipped a switch.  I don’t feel like I’m okay anymore. I don’t feel good. 

I’m in the constant panic state, I keep feeling trapped and I’m crying so much. I’m not enjoying anything. Going on walks when the weather is nice is just my absolute favorite thing to do, and I don’t want to. I feel like I don’t have it in me. 

Im scared that this recent event triggered something and now my medicine is useless. From what I’ve been told, I’m on the highest dose I can be. 

Monday I might try to find a new doctor that can help me, but I just don’t know. 

I’m not sure if this is something that can switch back again with time and me be content and good again, or if I’m back to being this miserably sad and depressed person again and need to figure out something with new medicine?

I have nobody to talk to or get advice from. So if anyone else has experienced something similar, but then you go back to feeling like the medicine is working, PLEASE tell me.

Flashbacks Of My Nightmares,"It is almost a year now after my major breakdown that led me to my hospitalization for 5 days and I can only remember the fourth and fifth day. I woke up exhausted like I travelled somewhere for so long. All I know is that I was able survive death. 

The ambulance ride was equivalent to thousands of years and it was like a terminal that connecrs me into differrent nodes of different datelines. My hallucination was probably severe due to extreme physical exhaustion and mental fatigue that caused dehydration and pottassium deficiency. 

This is the first day that I remember something really disturbing and painful. I cannot express or define it here since it was truly horrifying. Surviving all the kinds of torture that nobody else can ever imagine. These things never happened in my life. One of the scariest part of it all was to experience several kinds of death while I was asleep. 

I can't put anymore details to these things. Thinking about it is intensifying my anxiety. I am recovering and I have to avoid these haunting things. But I cannot keep it all inside. So, I hope writing it would be a good way to cope with it.

My psychiatrist has said that this is fine (for me, at least) and it's already pretty good that I can go out if I really need to, like for a doctor's appointment.

literally worst i’ve been ever,"i’ve sort of always had depression but it started to get bad later in middle school. Anyways, lately it feels like “i’m at my lowest” and i feel like it’s the worst i can ever be then it continues to get worse. In the past few months my boyfriend of over a year cheated on me then broke up with me which sent me to the mental hospital as i was already dealing with severe depression and this pushed it over the edge (or so i thought) after i got out i became friends with this girl who had sent me a gift box while i was in inpatient as she had also been, and befriended her. She now turns out to be a really shitty friend as she constantly blames things on me like when her mom found her vape and she said it was mine, or when she didn’t want to invite a girl to a party so she said i didn’t like her. However at the moment she is literally the only friend i have. I’ve had several breakdowns since i’ve been out of inpatient and am in intensive therapy for three hours a day, which is run by a lady who has treated me as well as other patients very poorly, and will kick people out as she pleases, as well as tell our parents we have random drugs in our systems that we didn’t do. They’ve also tried to send me back to inpatient after i had a breakdown and called the national suicide hotline because i legitimately had no one else to talk to. All of my friends at school have left me because i started hanging out with the girl who brought me the gift in inpatient, who obviously isn’t a good person, however she has shit on me and i know for a fact that she’d tell everyone if i unfriended her. She also won’t let me talk to guys she likes even though she has a boyfriend. I hate my life right now and feel so trapped. I cant cry or ask for help or i’ll be sent back to inpatient and my parents will loose all trust in me again.",Fickle-South-3899,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tug7kv/literally_worst_ive_been_ever/

I am F/30 and I have been heartbroken 3 times.,"I have been in therapy, even in a mental ward which I am ashamed to say, although they did put me there because I was struggling with housing while being abroad (I was a digital nomad), but it was also because I was sad after my divorce. 

I have now been unemployed for one year, although I have a decent career in marketing I don’t want to work in my country anymore. I just don’t want, it bores me to work here. I have been trying to get a job abroad without success (started looking in october then took a pause in december and kept looking since january…also my mom died last year and I stayed with my dad for christmas).

I don’t want to admit it to this fine gentleman who rejected me last time(after 4 dates and having sex in all of them) but I don’t want to live anymore.

I know it sounds like BPD but it’s not like I was addicted to him, there wasn’t much we shared but previously I got divorced after relationship of 13 years, 4 of them married, so I feel like life blasted me. 

I live because I still have a dad and brothers and a sister but I feel like I am not enjoying living at all. 

I go out of bed, I shower daily, I cook, I clean, I work out, I fix my hair and make up sometimes…but I don’t enjoy living at all.

Need help to start studying,"I was diagnosed with depression in January and since then have been on 15mg escitalopram and 50mg of amisulpride.
I also take a 0.25mg of clonazepam in the evening.

Over the weeks my appetite, and my thoughts and mood have greatly improved and suffice to say that they are as to what ""normal"" is for me.

But an issue that remains is that I can't get myself to study. My exam are in 50 days, and I've been patiently waiting for myself to recover from the vegetable state I was, and not tax my brain during that period.

But now that i have improved, I decided to start studying, but my motivation to pick up the book and read is close to zero. I can think of all the ways I'll study, and how I'll learn and plan, etc etc, and it feels nice, but when it comes to actually studying, I cannot get myself to it.

It feels like a feeling of dread and inertia envelopes me, and prevents me from picking the book up and starting.

I have tried meditation and a lot of other techniques, but none see to work.

Do I need some change in medication?
Is there some technique or book that could push me to start studying?

I used to be very productive before the depression, and i know I'm not lazy and this has something to do with the depression. My psychiatrist has said it takes longer for motivation to come on medications, but i want to do my part to help myself improve and become better, a bit faster. Exams are approaching.

I (f18) have no idea what I've been going through for the last 5-6 years of my life.,"I'm simply exhausted by everything. I have random bouts of extreme stress and sadness, as well as extremely intrusive thoughts, and it feels like there's no end in sight. When things start to clear up, it's as if I never felt that way in the first place; I was being dramatic/it wasn't as serious as I thought it was, and life is great. But when I get back into that position, it all starts over again, and it becomes a vicious cycle. It usually gets worse in the fall. However, it's gotten progressively worse since I started college (last semester) whenever I get these periods/episodes. I used to get these when I was younger (I had a rough upbringing), but not as frequently now. The worst it's ever been was in 9th grade, when I was actively writing suicide notes but never intended to follow through on them and/or putting myself in situations where I would kill myself (hanging myself with a belt, taking random pills on spurts of extreme emotions) but never tried hard enough to actually kill myself (I know it doesn't make sense, but it somehow makes sense to me). I used to self-harm during these times as well, but I realized how stupid it is and how it doesn't actually help, so I stopped. I tried doing more positive things like going for walks to clear my mind or writing about how I'm feeling, and it did help for a while, but it seems like something works for a while and then I need to do something else. As if I'd developed a tolerance. Honestly SH feels better than those two now thinking about it. The last two times I had these moments, I was terrified by something. I'm not sure what it's from. Deep down, I'm afraid of myself. I'm not sure what I'd do to make myself so afraid of myself. I feel like I have too much pride to kill myself, but I think it's because I'm wondering if that's true...? I have a lot of dreams and goals that I know I'll achieve, and I don’t want to throw that away. I'm at a loss for what to do right now. I can't concentrate enough to do anything else, like watch a show or browse the internet. I deleted all of my social networks because I felt they were a total drain on my time. I don't have the energy to go for a walk. I don't want to SH, and I don't have anything to SH with in the first place. I'm in a bind. I've been staring at the wall for the past 30 minutes while my friend was talking to me about something unrelated (I'm very good at masking whenever I have these periods of moments, and have been doing so for the last 5-6 years). I considered seeking assistance. I haven't been diagnosed with anything, but there's clearly something wrong with my mind. Part of me seriously thinks I'm just a dramatic person, but I do have a family history of things like this (alcoholism, substance abuse, Bipolar depression, generational trauma). I had a difficult childhood, but I believe it never affected me. Some of my family members constantly remind me of how strong I am living through some of those experiences, and even though those experiences felt completely real to me in the moment of, whenever I'm out of it, it's as if it wasn't that serious in the first place and that they shouldn't tell me that I'm strong for something that anyone can live through. Maybe I'm delusory.

I don’t know… I feel like the crap I see on TV about depression doesn't apply to me, but that's because it's TV. I just don’t know. I honestly just want a logical explanation for what I am feeling. Someone to agree that something is wrong and that this is not a normal thing that a reasonably normal person would experience. I'm just confused about how I'm able to feel so mentally sick for a week or so and then feel completely fine and life is just going great.

Depression fuel.,"I don’t know if it’s gotten worse or if I’m just focusing on it more. I don’t think it really matters which one it is. Tinnitus seems to be pretty common in musicians. I don’t think many people have it as bad. The ringing is constant. The more I dwell on it the worse it gets. It makes sleeping a little more difficult. I can’t drown it out with music. Music just makes it worse.

I’ve always had a problem with hearing. Apd basically makes it a million times more difficult to differentiate between tones or understand what people say to me (especially with background noise). I know, ironic. A musician who can barely tell the difference between similar notes. Well it takes me a lot longer to tune my guitar but I manage. Somehow I’ll be more in tune than most people. Anyway…

i’m starting to lose grip on reality,"recently, one of my friends told me i tend to not take life seriously and i mean they aren’t wrong but it’s starting to make me seriously dissociate. i’ve been having problems in school this school year and it’s been tough for me to even step foot onto campus. everytime i do i feel like i’m being judged or i’m not doing what i’m supposed to or the expectations of everything just get into my head and i freeze up. i’m usually an honor roll student and this year i’m failing all of my classes since i’m not attending any of them. i try to do the work online but i just can’t understand it. i think this is where it all began. 

for the last week i’ve felt nothing but intense and strong emotions. whether i’m happy, sad, anxious, horny, embarrassed, etc it was entirely extreme and to a point where i didn’t like the feeling. i take lexapro as a prescribed medication and i have been slightly on and off with it recently. this week i had only taken it maybe once but before i had taken it probably for a month straight; maybe missing a day or two. i’ve been dealing with mental illness since i was about 11 years old and got help for it when i was 13ish. i’ve been through a lot for only being a minor. it’s been really tough and has made me mature a lot. i think this could be as to why i’m out of reality, because i’m tired of what i’m in right now.

in 2011, my parents had a car accident. neither of them died but my mom ended up being disabled for life, dealing with pain for the rest of her life and my father has back problems along with having to be her emotional support. they have a great relationship being the conditions they’ve suffered. but for me unfortunately, i lost my mom in the way of she would never be the same she was. she has had three neck surgeries, seeing her that way was well trauma inducing to someone who wasn’t even in middle school. at the time, i didn’t realize it. i thought this was normal, something every kid went through. and as i got older i realized, this is something serious, something i’ve dealt with my whole life that no one will ever really understand. 

you’re probably wondering, ‘why the hell did OP go back to 2011? what does this have relevance to the title?’ recently, september of 2021 my mother had a knee replacement surgery and that… that is something that changed me. thinking about it makes me tear up. i just couldn’t bare to have my mother go through another surgery, and for her to have her other knee undergo the same surgery within a year or two after? how can i deal with this. how can she deal with this? will this deteriorate everything? and i mean it didn’t deteriorate everything but it definitely took a toll on me. my own mother couldn’t even walk properly for about a month without a walker or assistance. she still can’t walk far without a cane. it’s so hard to see. i just want to wake up and hope that this is all some sick dream. but it’s not. it’s reality. and that’s why i don’t take it seriously. because i can’t handle the truth. i can’t handle the fact that my mom can’t walk the grocery store without being in pain. i can’t handle the fact she can’t work. i can’t handle the fact she can barely cook. i can’t handle the fact she can’t do anything a normal person can. it’s so hard. 

because of this surgery, i haven’t been to school because i just get too anxious about what’s surrounding me and what could be going on at home. from sept 2021 to april 2022 (when this has been posted) i have been in a daze. i played games. day and night. i played them for hours, indulged myself into them. i tried to forget everything, everything from my life that was happening. i would wake up and play my stupid games. and then go to bed once i was tired. and repeat for several months. soon enough i was put into a group. it didn’t really help. i had horrible eating habits, my sleep schedule was horrible, my feelings were pushed down into a box and pretending like nothing was happening. i shoved away reality. i shoved away my friends as well. they are still with me luckily, as they know i’m going through a lot and don’t mean to be ignorant. 

the reason i’m writing this post is due to the fact that yesterday, i was at a volleyball game. i was supporting my friend who was a manager for the team. i would suddenly just go blank, stare out into space and be left with my thoughts, not sure of my surroundings. it was a dangerous feeling. i didn’t like it. i hadn’t experienced it that bad. it was something i never wanted to experience again. i was trapped, trapped in my thoughts. i didn’t like that. my friend noticed and snapped me back into the moment. we make this joke about how i need a reality check because well, i do. but in that instance, i really did. i’m starting to question everything. myself, my friends, my family, anything you could think of i just don’t think is real. i feel like this is just some fever dream. i don’t feel like i’m real or anything is real. i don’t like it. it makes me want to throw up. i don’t know what to do about it.",gaytoad69,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tub66l/im_starting_to_lose_grip_on_reality/

My mom found a new husband in less then 1 year after my dad died,"(Trigger warning: suicide)
My parents where together for over 30 year and married for 18. Early last year my dad commit suicide and it was a shook for the family, the same night my mom tried to commit by Overdosing on pills. I found her in her bedroom, thankfully she was still conscious, just really out of it. We called 911 and I think they pumped her stomach at the hospital. She came back home 2 days later. 

Fast forward 10 months she is now in a relationship with with a man she met in Jamaica 6 years ago on a vacation with my Dad. This made me and my sisters very upset because how fast she moved on from my dad and how it’s only been 10 months since he’s died. Also we found it odd that she met him 6 years ago and that they where in contact even when my dad was alive. Also she has been to Jamaica alone without my dad and who knows maybe she has been meeting with this man behind my dads back! She is now flying to Jamaica getting married to him this month. She has been spending all my dads life insurance and pension money on this new man and never gave me or my sisters anything. She bought a big house that she can’t even afford anymore and is buying her self and her new husband thousands of dollars worth of clothes, shoes, electronics and resorts. She managed to blow through 400k in a year. ( not counting her house and her new fully loaded truck)

I still think about my dad every single day and I just can’t believe my mom moved in so fast. I’m mad at my mom and want to hate her but she’s the only parent I have left.

Financial issues,"I wonder if anyone else is depressed for the same reason as I am. I started becoming depressed last year when I was denied Pandemic Assistance from unemployment when I got severe Covid and had to leave my job. They told me that I had to pay back the money I had been sent thus far. I got a waiver for it. But then I had to wait a whole year to find out if I was approved for federal PUA. I just learned yesterday that I was denied, even though I clearly qualify. And now they are saying I owe the money again because it’s federal and not state. So I have to ask for another waiver or appeal it. This sent me into another depression. I just feel like there’s no hope. And I can’t do any of the things I enjoy because I have no interest in them. I just can’t believe that someone hiding behind a faceless government entity decided to ruin me financially for no reason whatsoever. They literally want to take the only money I have and leave me penniless. And I’m the one who was sick and lost my job. It just depresses me that the world is so heartless and cruel.

Hey y'all,"I was diagnosed with depression and ADHD at 11 years old. I tried a few combinations of meds but I hated the way they made me feel. I refused to take any and stopped seeing the psychiatrist by age 13. Here I am 14 years later and I have kinda hit a low. I thought I was coping well with my symptoms, but I don't think I am anymore. I feel like I should be happy? Like I have the career I thought I always wanted(veterinary nursing), I have been in a healthy relationship for the last 8.5 years of my life, I am buying my first home this year, and I am finishing grad school within 3 years. I just don't know what I would have to be so sad about. Like I have family that loves me, a supportive BF, a ton of animals that make me happy, but overall I am still just sad and exhausted all the freaking time. 

Also, Is there a name for like, wishing you would die? I don't think I would call myself suicidal, because I wouldn't kill myself, but sometimes I wish there would be some freak accident and I would just be dead, you know? Not have to deal with shit anymore. Maybe it's the same thing

I am hesitant to try medications again but interested in psychiatric care. are there any good resources you guys have used for building healthy coping mechanisms in the meantime? What are questions you would ask providers when looking for a therapist, how do you know they're a good fit? Was therapy enough for some of you, or did you ultimately need to turn to medications?",Wachholtz,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tual0h/hey_yall/
Does the feeling of emptiness ever go away?,"I am a 35 year old male whose life is objectively good, but I always feel empty. I recently moved to Europe for a job and my wife and I are doing a long distance marriage as her mom is terminally ill. Most days I just work, maybe make something to eat and then drink. I don’t really find joy in anything that I used to enjoy (reading, photography, movies) and just feel like an empty husk. I have always had anxiety, but this is the first time in my life where I have just felt empty and devoid of any desire to do anything.

I skipped work today... again,"I recently got a job after searching for months and after working there for a few weeks I don't mind it. I thought I was doing ok for a while, but I have since realized that I'm not. My anxiety is so bad that I have developed a dependency on/addiction to stomach medicine and have had two major panic attacks in two weeks. I can feel myself losing interest in the things I used to enjoy, and I'm just so tired all the time, even on my days off from work. I'm struggling with intrusive thoughts again as well. I just can't help but feel useless since I can't even keep a basic job down and today was the second time I've called in. My manager yelled at me that it was my responsibility to call someone else to come pick up my shift even though I don't have a single person's phone number and I only just started working there so I don't know anyone else. I'm scared that by calling in I have lost my job and that makes me feel even more like I'm a failure. 

I wonder if going to the mental ward would help but I'm not necessarily suicidal and I have never done so before so I have no idea if it would help at all. I do think medication might help, but I'm not currently taking anything for my anxiety or depression, although I have tried a few different ones in the past.",WargThorne,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttxmnq/i_skipped_work_today_again/

Losing interest in my last hobby.,"So  I've been losing interest in games for a while now, but due to both the  sunk cost fallacy and generally having nothing else to do, I don't want  to quit.

I used to love gaming,  especially back when I used to have friends to talk to while playing,  it's turned into a way to pass the time, I'm playing ffxiv and it's  fine, but I don't want to quit, as I've not done all the expansions I  own and don't want to waste money.

It's like this for many other games, and even with my PC itself I got it to  play games on, and if I don't play games, it's an expensive PC to just  watch youtube on.

Friend says hes gonna take his own life,"Hello. A little over a year or two ago, I cant quite remember, my friends house burned down and him and his family had to stay at his sisters house for a few months. Currently theres a huge fire going on near his home and he says if his house burns down again hes going to take his own life. I think hes being extremely irrational and he says that I have never experienced anything like that. he says he fell in to one of his deepest depressions during this time at his sisters. But from my perspective he was just living with more family, was still able to do the same things he did at his own home like play video games, go to school, and he even had his own bed. I cannot wrap my head around the fact that this would drive him to commit suicide. I want to know what happened there that would drive a person to suicide but he wont tell me and I think its only fair to me to ask because he has brought this up a lot and he refuses to talk to his parents or a therapist about his metal issues and telling ur friend that ur gonna take ur own life is extremely fucked up. He has never said he hates any member of his family except his nephew but it just sounds like his nephew is just an annoying kid nothing further than that.

if I had to be objective about myself...,"Long post ahead, sorry.



I have a very very low self opinion and self worth. 



I see myself as not even human some days. I feel like an alien who has integrated well enough, but I feel as if I'm always pretending. I'm pretending I'm happier than I am, that I'm more confident than I am, and that I am less selfish than I actually am. I don't trust most people. I assume everyone is either going to hurt me on purpose, or eventually on accident. I am deeply uncomfortable with praise. I worry that I will never believe I'm worthy unless I ""accomplish"" something.



I don't know how to talk to my family about my feelings. I feel alone most of the time. I feel like something is intrinsically incorrect about me, and whether that is my genetics or my experiences is beyond me. I remember very little about my early life, I mostly live only in the moment. I am self reflecting to the point that I feel like I'm never going to feel ""known"" by anyone. Not even my wife. There are more days than not where I think I'd be better off living alone from everyone I've ever met. I don't trust my partner, even though she is really good to me. We have hard times, but we are mostly able to maturely communicate with each other, which is something I never had with my family.



And honestly, I question how many of my feelings are real. I feel like i am gaslighting myself because I can't remember all the details about my past with my family and spouse. 
I feel like the person I used to be, the person I'm pretending I am right now for my loved ones, has to die. Because the real me is angry. 



The real me wants to scream. I am angry most of the time but I disguise it as sadness, because my mom was so angry all the time and I didn't want that to be me. The real me sees the toxic things my family does, but is resentful instead of forthright, because I dread conflict and hurting others. Therapy is terrifying because I am afraid to try and fail to get better. I'm afraid of my anger hurting others. I feel like my life has been a series of failures. A series of sacrificed expectations. A series of disappointments in myself and everyone else.  



And I am frightened that if I try to heal, I am going to be hurt more than I will be helped. I'm worried I'll lose everything. My family has given me everything I have. I live with my parents, and with my spouse. We are trying to set up a multi-generational home, because my parents have land. My partner and I would really benefit to inherit this land one day. And it feels selfish that that's one of the only reasons it feels worth staying here. 



But I'm too afraid to die. So the only way to stop this is therapy. And I'm going to a new therapist next week.",CupsOfSalmon,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tu9i0m/if_i_had_to_be_objective_about_myself/

Is there even an option,"I've never really understood my own feelings. Never wanting to bother people with something so useless, I haven't really opened up to anyone, only 1 friend over a 2 hour phone call. Even then I really struggled to put into words what I was really feeling. But eventually in the call I said what I never thought I could aloud, that I had thoughts of suicide often. I don't understand why I have these thoughts. I know I'll never actually commit suicide because of how much of a coward I can be. But I guess some small part of me hopes that I can find a real reason to actually do it. Sometimes I just wish that I had some drive to actually do it. But I don't, day after day, thinking that I want to kill myself, yet I never do it and I know I won't. The option of suicide seems so easy, yet so far away. I don't even know why I made this post. Probably just for some small validation I guess. I have no reason to want to commit suicide, I'm not depressed, I have a comfortable home, and some great friends. yet every time I have a group hangout, I come home just feeling like shit. Every time I talk to the coworker I'm into, I just feel like I'll always be alone. I'm so unable to just do things. I always say I'll do something later but later it feels so hard to just do it. I feel like such a bother to everybody, I feel like I'm never enough. I'm getting close to the time you're supposed to make career choices but I have no motivation to get to those. I say to people I'll go to school, I'll clean up, I just want to be out of the way. I'm pretty sure anytime I'm feeling like shit, it's very noticeable, because people ask me if I'm ok, and I just shrug it off, say I'm fine and move on, I feel like that's just a normal thing to do. Don't bother people with whatever little thing upset you today, they don't care, why would they care, you're just in the way. At work I try my hardest to help people out because I feel like if I don't I'll just have no reason to even be there. I don't think that helping people makes you a good person, I help people because I know I'm not a good person, I just want to be as little a burden as possible, tip a lot, help with rent, pay for my own living expenses.

"I dunno what to say, but just needed to say something I think"," 

Im so tired I don't know if I should get antidepressants (I really don't want to (I dont have a family GP) but I know I need to) im in the Vancouver, BC area if anyone wants to help.

I just broke up (It wasnt too serious, we're still friends and still talk)

I feel the full effects of burnout (and I have 6 things due next week, but cannot muster the energy to even get through the last week of school)

And now I just feel empty. Not lonely or anything. Just empty. Im not feeling sad, Im not feeling happy, Im just so completely void of anything in my mind. Usually my mind is super active, questioning everything, looking forward into the future and seeing how everything plays out. But my mind today is just empty. I dont know what happened, I just woke up, and felt empty, no thoughts, no perception of stress, no perception of time (today has been so goddamn long), and not even a perception of being scared or hopelessness. I don't feel hopeless, I dont feel anything right now. I am just really, really tired.

Just that I really don't see any purpose to existing (not living, just existing). Im not questioning life or conciousness itself. Im just questioning whether or not I have the will to keep going. I know things can get better, and things can get worse. But I just dont know if I can muster that energy to do something to get better. Like obviously, breaking up has made this feeling worse, but yeah I can always move on and talk to someone else etc. But I dont know I want to go through that process again. I don't know how to describe it, I don't feel useless, I just don't feel anything right now.

Every time I think I've made a breakthrough in my mental health, I seem to lose that thought (thats not fully what I mean, but I dont know how to word it.) And every time I talk to someone, whether it be a friend or therapist, my mind blanks out and empties itself. As if all these meticulously processed thoughts just drained out of me completely.

"I Don't Want to Die, But I don't want To live","Hi, 

Long story short, first covid, and then general stuff has ruined my life. I once was in shape, fun, social, and had a future ahead of me, Covid hit when I was 23 and my entire life has derailed since then. My work is killing me, 60 hour work weeks dealing with horrible people. Fitness is gone to the way side, I have stretch marks ruining my arms, I REFUSE to wear a short sleeve shirt anymore because of how my arms once looked. (Something that gave me great pride) 

My closet's friends and family have either straight up abandoned me or continue to gaslight me and diminish me until I gave up (I caught my mother lying to me today and instead of apologizing she made me feel bad for attacking her with my ""Vicious attitude"" ) . I have one person left in this world. An Ex girlfriend who agreed to become my friend, after 6 months of her moving on from me. She is the only person I love in this world, and save for my cats, is the only I am here today. 

I don't have anything left in the tank. I can now see that my life will amount to nothing. IF I am lucky, I will live to 60 before dying of liver failure due to the alcoholism, that has affected me over this past year. I want to die, but won't do it because of how it will affect those who I care about. 

What's scared me and forced me into this situation is the fact that I am no longer fearing if I die. I am starting to make sense of it all, and thinking that if I made it look like an accident maybe just maybe, it might spare those who I love another level of pain, making them believe it was an accident, not that I chose to leave them in this world. \]

I apologize for this, I just need help. maybe because I'm scared. Maybe other reason, I want to change my life, I have hopes for it, and maybe this is my last ditch attempt to start to change for the better. Either way, Right now, I need someone, someone to be that shoulder to rest their head and cry on, because I don't have it in my normal life. Thank you all.

Does weed help?,"I have severe depression/anxiety. I stopped taking meds last year because I thought I was finally equipped to take care of myself. I’m not, surprise! I will start taking them again soon, but I have few days before my appointment with my doctor. Until then, I have been having panic attacks daily and feel a tightness in my chest like I am on the verge of one multiple times I day. Removing myself and focusing on breathing or just letting myself cry for a few minutes is getting to be frequent and really bothersome. I have never smoked or drank or really did any other drugs because lack of control is a major anxiety trigger for me, but I’ve never felt this intensely miserable for this long and I’m just desperate for some relief. Even when I take meds it takes a few weeks for them to fully kick in. Does weed help with depression/anxiety symptoms, even temporarily? Or should I just not even bother?",raddishpanda,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tubslo/does_weed_help/

[Seeking Advice] Shut out by depressed wife,"My (34M) wife (37F) suffers from depression and anxiety. I should also mention that she is currently pregnant, something we've both been very excited about, but as a result she is not taking any medication. Shes been anxious of course as this is a first for both of us but we've made it into our second trimester so most of the miscarriage concerns have abated, and all our doctors visits have gone well.

She almost never talks about her depression, but throughout our relationship I've worked to pick up on her triggers. While her anxiety is fairly constant her depression comes and goes in waves. She'll be her usual happy, affectionate, self for months at a time, and then something will trigger her and she'll spiral into a depressed state for a few days. During these times she will withdraw from our relationship, saying almost nothing to me for duration, isolating herself around the house, and sleeping a lot, but she keeps up her work obligations just fine.

Typically after a few days of this (I'd say 2-3 is the common length), she starts to feel better, opens up again, and often apologizes to me though I assure her theres nothing to be sorry about. During these periods I try my best to give her space, do household chores, and make sure she is eating. Shes expressed that she worries I'm mad at her when this happens, which I believe is trauma from a previous relationship, but I've never lashed out or indicated that Im frustrated during these periods, and when she comes out of these states theres no ""reckoning"", I just tell her I love her and I'm glad shes feeling better. It sucks, but after the first 2 or 3 times this happened in our relationship I had figured out the pattern and eased my own resulting anxiety from the sudden freeze.

This particular episode has broken the pattern I've experienced. We're now on day 5 of the latest episode. On Sunday she was kind of on edge, but we were doing our usual routine. We went to pickup some food and by the time we got back she was silent. I figured it was the usual and she'd be okay in a day or two, but here we are almost a week later and shes still shutting me out. When I say shutting me out I mean it, she literally has not said a single word to me, verbally or via text, since Monday evening. We have not had a conversation since Sunday afternoon. She will not look at me. Shes also avoiding being in the same room as me. She is coming to bed at night, but seems to be waiting until I have been in there for a little while before doing so. Even during past depressive episodes we've never gone more than 2 days without talking at all, and she has never avoided me so severely.

This is the longest this has gone on in our entire relationship, and the least amount of communication we've ever had during one of these episodes. I'm sure that part of it is the lack of medication because of the pregnancy, and its possible that the hormonal changes of her pregnancy are whats making this one so bad, but I have no idea what brought it on or how long its going to last because she only seems to have become more withdrawn as the week has gone on. I'm worried about her, I'm worried about the baby, and I'm also starting to breakdown myself. Normally the first day of this is the hardest for me because its an unexpected shift, but since the usual pattern has not held I'm starting to despair a bit.

Apologies for the long explanation, but does anybody have any advice? I don't want to make things worse but in 5 days there hasn't been any communication at all and I have no idea what to do except wait.

How do you change therapists?,"About three months ago, I started to go to a therapist that was introduced to me by some friends. I was unemployed and she was rather young and inexperienced.

I thought something was better than nothing, considering my state of mind and started having sessions with her.

In the process, I got a job and moved to a new city. I'd still be working on getting away from the toxic people/situations, but often the advice I got from her, which I agreed with during the sessions, didn't help.

Yesterday we had another session and she told me that I should get back to her after having worked on some of my own issues on my own.

Right now, having slept on it, I realise that she probably felt discouraged with the lack of progress in me and her inexperience in communicating that probably came through.

I don't have any negativity towards her but I'm wondering what I'm supposed to do next. Am I supposed to look for a new therapist? Am I supposed to cut her off?

She helped a lot with the validation that I was not at fault in the situations I was in and helped me gain confidence.

But right now, I wonder, what can I expect a new therapist to be able to do? Am I beyond help?

I've read about people changing therapists because they're not comfortable with them. But I was very happy with the emotional support she provided. She was just inexperienced. 

Do I go back to her and discuss this? Do I write to her about this? Do I tell the people who connected us that she's unable to help me? How much of this is my fault?",man_eating_chicken,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tubeno/how_do_you_change_therapists/

I dont know what I need to be happy,"First of all, I consider myself a decent english speaker. But english isn't my first language so apologies for any language mistakes.

I'm luckily able to have fun and be happy sometimes. I love my job and I think I'm doing well. I'm also very extroverted and love meeting new people and a lot of my friends consider me funny.

But lately I have been in a weird state where I constantly judge everything I do. To the point of imagining situations that didn't even happen.  And if I'm not judging myself, I'm panicking about something that I can't control (like people being hateful and negative on social media)

 I constantly look back at my childhood days and how happy I was. Even though my life is so much better now theoritically. And I'm not that old so it wasn't even a long time ago. Never has nostalgia and memories felt toxic to me like they are now. I'm always reminded how happy I used to be and I wonder what changed. 

It doesn't help that I have some family members who are also struggling with depression. And I find myself often being the one to trying to help them. But I dont know who to reach out to since they are already going through much. 

As I said, I'm very extroverted and I love chilling with friends and family. But lately it's feeling like everyone is trying to avoid me. It is probably my imagination but I can't help to shake that feeling of loneliness

I dont know what changed, is it Covid? Is there something that I'm doing wrong? I'm so tired of constantly feeling alone, tired, and sad.

I did a really stupid thing today,"Today has been really rough…..hell every day has been since I was 9, I’ve been suicidal since I was 12, im now 17, missed out on most of my childhood and now im already completely burned out, I have literally no motivation at all, hell most of the time I have no motivation to kill myself, which I guess is good.            
But today was different, idk what it was but something pushed me over the edge, I was feeling ready, so, I got out my gun, cocked it and pulled the trigger.
Now I know it’s nothing because it wasn’t loaded, but I knew if I could convince myself it was, I would be ready for when it is.
Soon enough I was, I loaded it and sat there, waiting, now I obviously didn’t do it, there where 3 things that helped. 
1.I decided to listen to Johnny cash and billy Joel while I decide, which I guess helped calm me down.
2.my cat, he came in my room and wouldn’t leave my side, that was unusual, he’s not a cat that likes to be loved on.
3.the thing I failed to mention, it was a .22, that’s why it took me so long to decide, I didn’t want to survive from this.

I know actually doing it would be stupid, but the fact that I actually had a loaded gun to my head was not only stupid, but scary, I’m honestly scared of myself, I’m going somewhere today where there’s a gun that’s way more powerful than a .22, and im honestly scared shitless that a episode is gonna come and this time, I’ll actually pull the trigger.

maybe the right move?,"I've been really suicidal recently, partly because I ran out of my meds for like a week. Well I have a plan but that involves spending about $100. So this month, instead of spending that $100 one suicide items, I spent about $70 on magic the gathering cards on eBay.

I'll be getting over 2300 cards, from unknown sets, so I don't know if any of my cards will be standard format or not. But it'll give my brother and I something to do beyond playing video games all day.

Plus if we ever manage to get a car, there are a couple tournaments around that we could potentially go to. Would be nice to meet some new people, have a few friendly matches. Haven't done that in years. Best part is now I have money so I'll be able to play drafts when they come up because that used to be a $40 entry fee.

Did I make the right move? I'm sure at some point in the next week I'll regret doing it but I figured it might as well go towards something fun, rather than killing myself.",Emotional_Boot4693,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tu43j3/maybe_the_right_move/

Mirtazapine has been added to my medications and its hit me like a brick,"So I've been on Sertraline 200mg for around a year now. My depression has been steadily getting worse during this time and my insomnia meant I was sleeping at a max of three to four hours of unbroken sleep. To add, I have severe sleep apnea which doesn't help. I've been off work, zero energy, extreme fatigue to the point of being bedridden and an extremely low mood.

Anyway, my doctor has put me on Mirtazapine 15mg alongside the Sertraline (which I've reduced to 100mg) and what the hell?! It's completely blown my mind.

The first night, I was super cautious about taking it as I was taking type antidepressants (although one is an SSRI and the other a NASSA). I really thought it would trigger serotonin syndrome and I'm terrified of that. So I took it and I slept from 2am until midday the next day. That's the longest I've slept in two years. Last night (the second night), I took it at 8pm and was asleep by 8:30pm. I slept until 2am, was awake for thirty minutes and then slept until 9am. I read that it has sedating properties but jesus christ. I'm not evening taking the full 15mg because I was cautious, 7.5mg definitely feels more than enough.

Has anyone else has much experience with Mirtazapine and another SSRI/SNRI? I'm so thankful for the sleep but the past two days I've been like a walking zombie. I've seen that this is an incredibly common side effect when you first start taking it. It's exciting as I think this might be the medication combo that's working for me.

Also, apparently (under direction from a doctor and it being monitored) taking Mirtazapine and another SSRI/SNRI has been termed 'California Rocket Fuel' in studies as its blasted people out of severe depression.

At the moment, I don't brush my teeth most days, and the days I do, I only do it at night. I can't remember the last time I had a shower (I clean myself sometimes with baby wipes). My parents make sure I eat, if they didn't I probably wouldn't.

From what I gather of how people go about life, the bare minimum seems to be to brush your teeth twice a day, shower every day, make your own food, do your own laundry, do your own washing up, get a job, deal with people, and probably more that I've forgotten, though people's idiosyncratic circumstances and stuff result in different experiences.

The bare minimum is too much for me. It's too hard and completely unenjoyable, and I can't say I have any desire to go through it. To be honest, I don't seem to have any desire for anything anymore, just fog and numbness.

I can't even seem to muster the energy to try anymore. Surely all the therapies and medications we've tried, something should have helped by now, so all I can think is that it's down to me not trying hard enough or not being strong enough.

If given the opportunity to do anything - I choose sleep. My mom tells me that as a child all I ever wanted to do was sleep. I easily sleep for 12 hours a night and then can nap again a few hours later. I'm 45 and in my 30's I pushed through. Worked 12 hour shifts and then would go out only because it felt like I had to. The whole time I would be thinking about how I am going to make up for the loss of sleep or about how tired I was. Now there is just no way that I would ever go out at night and am often in bed at 7pm. Work has become hard because I am just that tired. I often skip it to sleep and suffer financially. My body is tired, my mind is tired, my whole being is just wrapped up in dreaming about those moments in bed. I would quit my job in a heartbeat if it was financially feasible - just so I could sleep more. It has gotten really bad in the last 3 years. I recently opted to have an elective surgery because I knew that I would be able to sleep uninterrupted afterwards for weeks. Sometimes when I am at work, it feels like I literally can't hold my head up because I am so tired. I have summers off and guess what I do.... Endless series of sleep and naps. Maybe I am depressed but I am also on medication for it. My health has suffered because of my lack of movement. I don't even fear death because death means sleep.

Sad Hours / Rant,"Don’t really know a decent way to format it all, so yeah- get ready to be confused with all this

Got indirectly ditched today after using most of my day waiting/getting ready to hangout with some friends. Was worried that they wouldn’t message or anything when they all got together and that’s exactly what happened.

I was pissed at myself for wasting a day for all that, which quickly turned to just being sad as fuck. 

Now I’m just here dreading having to work at a bullshit job tomorrow and deal with all that. Can’t really call out either as I’ve used up whatever they allow normally.

Lastly, I’m wanting to go on an impulsive trip somewhere. I don’t have a destination in mind right now, but getting to just escape all worries for a bit sounds really nice right now.

"in so much Pain, I am so tired.","My gf just ended a relationship with me a few days back. I have been struggling with this. We have been together for 10 years.

Over the course of the relationship, the earlier years were fantastic. Amazing. In the halfway mark, things changed. I think my depression and my own character got in the way of everything. She has given me multiple chances to change and be a better partner and lover. And I always told her I will change, but I somehow end up going back to my old ways.

Last 9 months ago, we had a major argument, and she decided we should take a seperation in our relationship. I reluctantly agreed.

But I decided to make the best of it. Fight this depression and go back to her. In the midst of a new job and making improvements in life, doing mediations, making positive changes. I neglected her.

I didn't show her that I still wanted the relationship. We still meet up every 2 weeks or so. But there was no communication on our relationship, on the plans on how to go back together.

Few days ago, she finally made up my mind and got tired of waiting for me. I am much better as a person 9 months ago. I got that sudden clarity that being with her is what I want. Her being my wife. Fighting for our future.

But, it's a bit of too little too late. She won't belive a thing I say now. And breaking off will make her happier.

I am so tired of my life. I keep fucking up time after time. I fundamentally wonder whats wrong with me. I had someone good in my life, and I screwed it up.

Sometimes I Regret Going on Anti Depressants,"I'm not going to drop my bupropion prescription because I really need to keep going to my job, but it really feels like it has less taken away the misery and more sharpened it. I used to just feel awful in general and just feel numb, but now I'm agonizingly aware of all the ways I've fucked up my 34 years of life, how little I compare, and what I'll never have. I should take this as a spur to do something, but it just seems so insurmountable. I've got a job now at least, that's kind of an improvement. Now when I take my cat to the vet I can pay the bills instead of adding to the mountain of credit card debt. And my parents worry less about me. Good things.

Trying to overcome old negative self beliefs.,"I (26F) have always seen myself as small and invisible. Often it hurts to look at myself in the mirror and I’ve lost motive to do any of the things I used to love. I have good connections but my closest friends are far away, and I often feel like I don’t add anything to our friendship other than my negativity and talks of self hatred. 

My mood is always up and down and I have a hard time validating my reality. I can’t tell if people are disrespectful to me or im hypersensitive to any type of interactions. 

I recognize that most of my negative perceptions are basic depressive symptoms… creating distortions from reality, but I fall into it again and again. 

I don’t know if im being too hard on myself or it’s a natural sense of urgency, but I keep telling myself that I’m 26. I’m no longer a young adult, yet I feel like I’ve been living most of life turned off and I don’t know how to turn myself back on. 

I recognize hopelessness is merely a symptom of depression but I hate the thought of me going on like this. The thoughts of self harm and suicidal ideation am are not as bad as before but are becoming intrusive once again. 

There’s nothing external that should be keeping me this low but I can’t stop with the negative self beliefs. And I often (not as a conscious choice) use this fact a sign that I am incompetent and incapable of basic tasks. 

I have tried the counseling service thru my school, but there is only one counselor for the whole school so sometimes it’s challenging to make consistent appointments. I’m not in the position to afford a committed therapist, as I do not have insurance.. I am not working to focus on school, and have changed my diet into more nutritious meals as well as include exercise into my daily routines. 

The minor changes like a healthier diet and exercise had helped, but I’m still trying to pull myself out. And I just want to live my life the best I can in acceptance of myself. 

I’ve never posted on Reddit, and I would like to hear others journeys related to what I shared.

"I feel I have zero intention of suicide, but have thought about it for over a decade","I'm in my mid 20s, and since around middle-school I can remember thinking about suicide, and planning it as a thing I'd do if I didn't ""figure things out"" or feel proud of something by a certain time in my life (Back then, I always thought ""18"" since it seemed so far away). Since even before this, I've always found myself very easily feeling bad about my own actions/decisions/experiences, or my situation, and it tends to spiral in to these thoughts. Currently, I'm in my 5th year of college on my second major in STEM, and I believe my progress is about halfway to being a ""junior"" in said major; my boyfriend works and supports us, and I can't help but feel a bit useless lately. 

&amp;#x200B;

Regardless of that, I recognize the progress I'm making, and these kind of thoughts have been impacting my ability to focus on my studies and handle my friendships properly; I've grown really aware of how intrusive they feel, and I guess I wanted to ask if anyone else has a similar experience. It feels legitimately odd and, at times, very frustrating to recognize how consistent this line of thought has been, and how negatively it impacts my mood to just route to such thoughts so easily. I'd also like to say that I have a therapist appointment set up soon, which will be my first since I was a young teen.",GeneralShopping4198,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttp18j/i_feel_i_have_zero_intention_of_suicide_but_have/

not sure where it came from tbh. for the first time in 4yrs, i was able to think about my future without suicide being in the way. i havent been able to do that since i was 12ish. i wouldnt say its been good, its just been better.

I haven't been feeling well lately,"&amp;#x200B;

So I've always been a small, shy and scared kid, first problems with self esteem and social life started when I was about 13. Probably not a big deal, every teenager sometimes have issues like that. But everything got much worse when the pandemic started, social isolation and other connected with it things affected me so much. I had strong suicidal thoughts and was fantasizing about killing myself. I spent these almost 2 years just sitting all days at home, laying in bed and crying. I had stopped taking care of myself, which resulted in health problems, terrible acne and this obviously caused even more issues with self acceptance. Didn't have any friends, anybody to even chat with a little bit. I was so scared of going out, I wasn't even able to leave my room and go outside. Some time ago I tried to do something and help myself. Started working out, found new hobbies, but still felt like shit, which resulted in a suicide attempt. Well, it didn't work as it should and I'm still here. As I went back to school things got slightly better. I tried to go out as much as I could and socialize, hoped that I can still get away from that... But now I understand that once you fall down like this, you won't get up by yourself.  And now I'm 18 years old, have a social anxiety, very low self esteem, don't have any friends. I'm not smart, attractive physically and interesting in any way. I'm trying so hard to do something but nothing works, literally nothing. Why does it have to be like that? Why I can't have a life like other people my age? Oh and a bonus: I have severe hiperhidrosis which OF COURSE isn't helping in any way.

Food isn't enjoyable. Hasn't been for a while. Everything tastes pretty much the same. Meat taste like all meat. Fruit taste blah and veggies taste like grass (actually, my son had me eat ""lemon grass"" it tasted better). Maybe bc I shared that moment with him. I try to stay happy for them.

Need some help in decision making.,"Hello fellow redditers. 

I need some advice or rather support in making tough decision. Sorry for the long post, there is TL;DR below.

I've been diagnosed with a mixture of depression and anxiety for years now, don't know how long generally. In 2020 i thought I had overcome this struggle and for a short period maybe I actually did. 2021 brought darkness again so I did Camino de Santiago (not for religious reasons). This gave me some kind of a boost to continue living without meds till the end of 2021

In the January I felt the worst in years. In February I got back on meds and in therapy (only 2 times a month cause I can't afford more). I am on venlafaxine. It helps but still I feel pulled back into the darkness. I feel I don't actually live my life (and I really don't I guess). It's getting increasingly more difficult to wake up and when I wake up I can barely leave the bed. Last 3 days I spent without cleaning or showering. I work mostly remotely and I managed to fulfill my responsibilities so for the time being I was able to keep up, but almost everyday I started late. When I had to show up in the office I also got there late (first time ever). Just adding that the job didn't exactly meet my financial or other expectations and I am getting more responsibilities without an increase in pay (which is just enough to live on a basic level). Honestly, I don't care about this job anymore and I feel bad for it. Funny thing is never lied to my boss or did something unethical or unprofessional, I am actually pretty good working bee.

My new Doctor asked to put in time and work to actually overcome this sickness. She told me that perhaps it would be good to participate in an intensified group therapy. 3 months of different activities for 6 hours daily and it's covered by social insurance, which is quite important. Of course at first I was reluctant but I can't get this idea out of my head. She actually believes that I can be cured (i told her that we need to agree to disagree). 

And now I want to try it. I could go on a paid sick leave and focus on at least trying something new. The case is...

I feel ashamed. I feel like a cheater, a con-man for wanting to help myself instead of working for this big company (which actually has to cover my pay for 1 month, after that it's paid from public finances). I analyze this over and over and I just feel bad with myself for being happy with the perspective of not having to do all this pointless mundane job related things everyday. And I am happy that I will have more time and energy to maybe write my thesis after 9 long years of prolonged studies. Currently in my free time all I can do is watch movies and shows or sleep.

And I actually crave contact with other people who struggle with similar things and I really want to get over it, because I am so tired of being myself.

This fear of being a cheater and self blame are also fueled with memory of my last sick leave. It was during my first tango with depression and at one point I just couldn't go on, couldn't do anything. So I got a doctor's note. In my country almost all sick leaves are paid.

Now I am at the exact same point in life and I am scared that I do this semi intensionally. I mean I know that I didn't want any of this but still it just feels dishonest and I hate it.

I guess what I want is some help in making this decision, some kind of support. Pretty please and much gratitude for any helpful comments. 

TL;DR

Used to be depressed and filled with anxiety. Sort of overcame it. Now back at it. I want to go on paid sick leave (it's really common in my country) and participate in intensified group therapy (everyday for 3 months) but I feel ashamed and bad for not wanting to ride this out with meds and 2 hours of therapy monthly while working. Please help me make this decision.

Cheers.",GeneralQalmani,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tu5ge4/need_some_help_in_decision_making/

I’m on the brink of suicide,"I’m a 20 yo male, have a fiancé, have somewhat of a family and a couple friends and to the average person, seems pretty damn good right? Well this past month has been the worst time in my life and everyday Keeps getting worse. To summarize, my friend, my nephew and another one of my friends all died within 2 weeks of each other. Waking up to that phone call telling you your friend is dead and then 2 days later get a call saying your nephew is dead and repeat, it’s pushed me to the edge. My fiancé is the only one who seems to understand that I’m struggling and my friends and family just brush me off like everything’s ok even when I have my psychotic breakdowns. I have adhd, bipolar and intermittent explosive disorder so everyone thinks this is normal behavior from me. The thing is, I haven’t had a genuine breakdown in about 4 years (due to medications, weed etc. never ventured off into any other drugs though because it’s always scared me) but now even with my meds I can’t fucking take it anymore and nobody seems to bat an eye. I have a shitty job that treats me horrible. for example (I started about 2 months ago so I’m still kind of fresh) one of the managers asked me how many brain cells I have left because I was acting like a full blown retard. Every day I look forward to going into work and beating the ever living fuck out of those cunts. My fiancé is the only reason I haven’t done it yet because shes the only one who genuinely cares. My problem is, I feel so horrible putting her in this position. All the stress, anger, confusion etc that I cause her. I bring up those concerns to her and she always says that she’ll love me no matter what because she wants to be there for me and help me but a part of me can’t help but think that I’m gonna push her overboard and give her no choice but to leave for her sake.

its 2nd semester now and i didnt have this issue in 1st semester, even though in 1st semester my sleep was even worse. i slept at 2 or 3 basically every day doing homework or some other dumb shit like watching youtube out of anxiousness.

with AP exams coming up, future leadership positions in band (i'm to be captain next year), college, etc., i just feel like im not up to it anymore because i feel so slow and tired every goddamn day no matter what i do. i really hope someone could help me with this because i have so much potential for myself and its going down the fucking drain and i just want to feel normal and bright again

I have a stomach problem and I also get like chills? Like it's +6 outside as of writing this and I'm freezing, I'm under 4 heavy blankets and the chills aren't going away.

I don't eat very often, it's a miracle I keep up with the standard lunch and dinner routine. I'll eat dinner at around 3:30-4PM, then I won't eat anything until anywhere between 9 AM and 12PM, mostly towards the latter since I eat lunch. My psych says that's good, but I don't really see it? Like if I were not to eat anything from 5-6PM til 10 or 11 AM the next day, I think that's normal, but 3:30PM or 4PM til 11-12 the next day? Isn't that a bit.. not normal?

idk. I hate eating. I don't eat because it makes me feel awkward inside. I don't have any eating disorders as far as I know but I just don't like eating. I get anxious whilst eating. Which makes me eat super quick, like I can finish a whole bowl or plate full of food in 5 minutes. My parents tell me to slow down but it's like, I can't? I need to eat quick. I just need to.

Can't Get Out of a Rut - How to Improve?," I suppose I do not know where to post this. Things just haven't been going my way for a long time.

I have nothing going for me. I'm almost 25, never been in a committed relationship, don't *think* I've ever been in love, I have a job that I hate, and I have one friend who I see for a few hours a *year.* I have been unable to improve these situations. I have been trying, I really have been. I've been trying so hard.

I feel like I snapped today. I just feel like this is never going to end. I got rejected after 5 rounds of interviews for a company I applied for. I have sent out 247 applications over the past 5 months, and this is the closest I have gotten to getting a new job. A new job is the first domino that needs to fall for me to get things turned around; to get ""life"" started. A new job means I get to move out of parent's house, which means I can try to date, and do other things I cannot do in my current situation.

I have been working so hard to better myself over the last 3 years. I went back and finished my degree, completed a specialized post graduate program, exercise everyday, eat right, and try to be a bright person to those around me. I had never been so disciplined in my entire life. I used to be the fat, socially awkward loser. I have tried to recognize all my shortcomings as a person, and I have been working diligently to be the best version of me. I am trying to be kind to those who aren't; trying to be a good person to strangers; trying to be a positive influence on others; always moving the goalposts for myself and never being OK with the status quo.

I feel like I am the epitome of ""fake it 'til you make it"". Those around me potentially see me as this a positive person with drive, but the truth is, I am dying inside. All of that drive doesn't matter if it doesn't pay off. I have nothing going for me; I never have. The things that I value in life have never found me even though I look so hard to find them. And I'm not saying that I'm not responsible for any of this, and it's just bad luck--because this isn't the case. I deserve all of this. It's just that my hope is that, eventually, I'll be deserving of better. I'll find that one girl, I'll get that meaningful job, and I'll get that great circle of people around me.

I suppose I do not know what the purpose of me typing this all out has. Maybe it just feels good to put it out into words. I feel like I am different person than I was at 20 (for the better). However, I am so far away from the person I want to be. No matter how hard I try, however, I just can't get the ball rolling.

"""Why are you depressed?""","That's a question that bothers me. I'm not talking about people asking if I want to talk about it, I'm talking about instances in which a person's only interest is what dramatic event in my life could have worsened my clinical depression.

For starters, depression doesn't always happen for a reason. I don't need a reason to be depressed.

Even if I did need a reason, the reason I'm depressed shouldn't be relevant. I'll say why if I want to disclose that. Those I'm close to already know what's going on in my life. Those who genuinely want to help can be supportive without knowing why I'm depressed. Being asked why I'm depressed makes me feel like I exist to be a source of amusement for others.

"I think, I'm dependent on my sleeping tablets","I've been taking sleeping tablets for around 10 months. Changed them once or twice.

Anyway, when I took the full dose (1 tablet), I was very tired 1 hour later and basically non-functional 30 mins later.

I tried to take only half a tablet. I still got very tired after an hour. Told my psychiatrist about it and she approved it.

The problem is - I basically can't fall asleep without the medication even when I'm tired, but if I manage to or accidentally fall asleep, I will wake up every hour and after 6 hours I won't fall asleep anymore.

I have no idea what I am going through but it is exhausting,"Today marks 30 days since I started feeling exhausted and empty of life. I ve been wondering about my health and I ve been paranoid and panicking for 30 days. Yesterday it stopped, I am not afraid anymore and I stopped questioning it every 30 seconds. Still, one thing didn’t go away, this feeling I can t even begin to describe. I can feel that it is a brain thing, I don t feel sick, I m not in any form of pain, it s just there with me even when I am not thinking of it I can feel it through my vision. It s like my sight has a new layer of something boring, life sucking, it is blocking any form of emotion. I can still laugh and make jokes but as I said, I permanently feel this thing around me and in me. It isn t even that major to stop me from doing my day to day activitiee but it is there and doesn t let me feel anything like I used to. I have never been depressed or anxios and i am 21 years old. Have you guys ever felt something similar? Did it go away? How do i cope with it?

A little background: my dear grandfather died in february but I didn t give myself much time to grief over it. I thought this is what I m feeling, grief. But I saw that even when I m totally not thinking about my childhood and grandparents, the sensation is still there. This last month has been full with high heart rates and anxiety and that feeling of fear in my chest or the butterflies in the stomach. I started working, my university drains me out of energy, and I just feel like I am a completely different human than I was 2 months ago

"My negative, intrusive thoughts are killing me.","The levels of irritability, depression, and self-loathing I feel are really destructive and I am scared I won’t ever be able to escape my own brain. The support system I have of family, friends, and mental health professionals is objectively wonderful, and I feel tremendous guilt for continuing to feel like a completely hideous, worthless, undesirable waste of space. So much of my (40f) sense of self worth is wrapped up in never having had a good dating experience, never feeling attractive, or like any man on the planet will ever be interested in a romantic relationship with me. All of my experience has been either one night stands or casually dating men who ghosted, or being interested in someone who ended up being interested in a friend (seriously, I am not exaggerating when I say that at least 8 men I have wanted to pursue romantic relationships with have either been spending time with me in order to get with my friend, or happened to meet another woman I know and immediately decided they were a better option). It’s nearly impossible not to think that I’m just universally undesirable to all men and doomed to be alone and unloved for the rest of my life. I know that love/relationships are not everything, but I feel like there is something seriously wrong with me that no man has ever wanted me in over 20 years of trying to explore the dating world. It’s so hopelessly sad I don’t know how to keep surviving every day, thinking that I will never get to experience a real, intimate relationship ever. Years of therapy, multiple medication‘s to combat my depression and anxiety, a successful professional career, friends and family and several therapists have all expressed that they don’t understand why I can’t seem to find *ANYONE* who is a good fit and interested in me. Like, there has to be something seriously wrong with the way that I look, or who I am, if I’ve gotten to 40 years old and no one has ever wanted me, right?

Struggling with shame &amp; non-existent self-esteem,"For context, I’m 27F this year and have had low/no self-esteem for the longest time. I seek validation from external sources — men in particular — and it makes me feel so vulnerable and pathetic when I’m crushing hard on someone (infatuation, really), and not having that interest reciprocated. 

Yesterday night, I asked someone to hang via message. This morning, that person replied, and I might be reading too much into things… but it seems like he’s feeling pressured (?) to meet up with me, or he’s simply not interested at the very least. He’s a nice dude, really, and I feel bad that I might have made him feel uncomfortable. We’ve known each other for about 3 months, and met up 3 times so far. Each time, I have somehow managed to make a fool out of myself (partly due to anxiety + an overwhelming need to impress), and I’ve cringed recalling what happened afterwards.

I’m trying to keep things platonic but my anxiously-attached self just wants to pair bond with every semi-attractive man I meet, lol. Which brings me to my next point —

I want to become strong and independent. I cried a little this morning because I felt so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. Do I really need a guy in my life? Can I not do this on my own? Every time I perceive myself to have been “rejected”, even if it’s in the smallest way, I start to hyper-fixate and obsess; go through past memories and see where I went wrong. It’s true that I’m flawed — everyone is, I guess — but I just feel so much more flawed than the average person, to the extent of being unloveable. Both in looks and personality.

This is perhaps just a rant on how I feel like a total loser, and how I wish I were more physically attractive (I did not win the genetic lottery) so guys would like me. I know I have to work on myself, and find happiness/fulfilment from within. It’s just the hardest thing to do. I don’t want to become a burden to others though: friends, family, crushes etc… Just feeling crummy today overall. :( 

My next therapist appointment isn’t due for at least 3 months. I want to go for private therapy but god, is it expensive. But there’s this therapist whom I really like, and who really gets me — I feel seen and heard when I’m talking to her.

HOPELESS,"For the past 40 years I have dealt with Depression and haven't really sought out help for it until last year. I have been really struggling recently lately. So many questions have been coming into my mind and I continue to resort to Self Hate as an escape. I have thought of suicide recently and honestly believe that my life doesn't have a purpose. I feel so alone in this fucked up world and I question if there is anyone who truly cares. Being a Christian we are told that we cannot go through this life alone, but I continue to struggle to find anyone who wants to encourage me and stand by my side. I feel that whoever comes into my life has an ulterior motive for being there. They just want to take and take until I have nothing to give and ask for help, then I get the ""deuces"" and get ghosted. 

I have got to the point that I have started questioning and doubting that God does have a plan for me. It seems like I can pray for everyone around me and they will continue getting the blessings I have prayed for, but when it comes to me praying for help to overcome these feelings I have, He stays silent. I have really been doubting that he does care and love me. I have been asking the same questions almost everyday for the past 3 weeks. Where is God?  Am I destined to live this life of suffering alone? What is the point of continuing? Whenever I have reached out to someone about my problems regarding God and the pain of depression that I continue to suffer with daily, I get told that I am just attention seeking, that my feelings are not valid and, This one pisses me off the most, I just need to get over it.

Is it bad that I have prayed to die multiple times over the past 3 months? I haven't had thoughts of suicide lately but I have felt that it would be easier to just die. I am tired of living this way. Everyday waking up and believing that everything wrong with me is all my fault. That I am not strong enough to get these thoughts under control. I feel weak everyday from trying so hard just to make it through the day just to get home to an empty house and beat myself up more. Will anyone even notice if I was to disappear? or die? I am almost to a breaking point and just want to quit on life in general. I have walked it alone for so long that I honestly believe that there is no one for me in this fucked up world. That God has forsaken me and just laughs at me. That even with help through therapy and church and ""friends"" I will never get better. I honestly believe that I am destined to walk this life in pain and suffering for the remainder of my days.",Ronzill,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttwoxy/hopeless/
Seeking others using St. John's Wort,"Hi all,

I started taking 300 mg of SJW three times per day. But I take all three at once.... with dinner. Am I supposed to do one per meal? Does it matter?

Besides this concern, I'm curious about your experiences using this for depression. Also curious about how long I can be on this. I read that the limit is 12 weeks. My depression is chronic and recurring, so is this not a good solution for me?

**NOTE**: I predict that people will come in here saying it's placebo or useless. I know it's not for everyone, and I am aware that no one should ever take SJW with SSRIs. I'm not interested in those comments. I've read many systematic reviews of clinical trials in internationally-recognized peer-reviewed journals (I'm an academic...) that have shown SJW being more effective than placebo and just as effective as SSRIs for mild to moderate depression.

"I try, but shit is just so hard...","So... I (M39) normally do not talk about my problems, escpecially my depression or my socialphobic issues, but even though i do therapy for over two years now, there are moments like right now, when i wish i could talk about it with someone else than my therapist, just to feel some kind of support and hear that what I am doing is good... about myself... I have suffered my depression for over 25 Years now, i grew up as a middle child with an disabled older Brother that tried to kill my twice before i was 10, tried to hang myself with 14 and just survived because the rope snatched. My Mother allways critiziced me, told me all my mistakes, compared me to other kids when it was in her interest to show me more of my shortcummings, actually told me it was my mistake that my brother tried to strangle me and i should have minded what i said, while my father was either at work or thought it was necessary for educational reasons to be in unity with my mother. In the meantime i was bullied in school, was unable to have a real relationship or even a friendship, as i allways put up a front that left nothing of my personaltiy shine through and never really allowed anyone to actually get to know me...  So since i can remember I´m scared shitless to say the wrong things, scared to offend anyone, scared to lose people because of conflicts and as a result my all my social relationships became more and more superficial and I got myself isolated...  
After School i studied acting for 4 Years, became even more efficient in blending myself out, became an weed addict, isolatet myself more and more from other people until i just changed from Joint and Couch to stage and back and had finally noone left in my life but my parents, from whom i still wished to get some kind of recognition, some kind of authentic relationship, even just a little support would have been enough, but the relationship model just became more and more superficial. About 2.5 Years ago i was at a point, when i was numb to all of my feelings but sadness and despair, where i had suicidal thoughts non stop, when i had to play a part i did not enjoy, when i left my parents house and felt frustrated, when i woke up and had to get out of bed again, when i lay in the shower for 30-40 minutes trying to prepare myself for another day, when i smoked the first, second or tenth joint, when I felt like the lonliness was crushing me, when i went to sleep and knew i had to get up again in the morning - not one moment that i didn´t think it would be soooo much easier to just step out of the window, just crash a wall at 150 km/h, something quick to get out of it.

At that point i got lucky and got a spot at a therapist who was actually able to help me, I´ve been clean for over 2 years now, saved over 25.000 € in drug money, got myself a dog that makes me walk and breath a little easier in the woods, slowly reconnected to some feelings like anger and sattisfaction, even though I am still unable to find friends, still can´t talk about the nightmares of my youth because i dont want to burden people or scare them off. I actually started studying at the university again, try to connect to other people and broke contact with my family. But there are still moments like right now, even though i feel proud of what i was able to change in my life, i listen to the wrong piece, read the wrong book, remember the wrong thing and i feel like the pressure is back in full force, feel the anxiety under my skin, wish i had someone to tell all of that, it is moments like this where i really need some kind of support, just some kind of approaval or just someone to actually listen.  
So i hope i did not vioalte any rule with this post, sorry about my bad english, and thanks for reading my story, it would be great if you would leave me a comment.",NoExplanation1731,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttt1kw/i_try_but_shit_is_just_so_hard/

"This week, I had a tantrum.","Last week I turned 27, and two weeks ago I started a new job, three weeks ago I ended a relationship that I thought would be forever. And even going through everything I went through in the last year, which is a lot for a single post, I came to no conclusion about why something like this happened. I grabbed my keyboard and threw it against the door, I didn't feel anything else, just an immense anger about the life I have and everything that brought me here.

&amp;#x200B;

Today, about three days after this outbreak, I went shopping for clothes, and I simply stopped, wondering who I am, who I am and what brought me here. I went to the grocery store and bought some wine and made a lasagna, and I decided I need to open up about some things, so here we go.

\- I don't know what happened between my parents, my mother talks about my father with a face of ""I miss those times"" and my father just lives his life and diminishes everything I am or have.

\- I ended a relationship, which I believed to be very big, but I was only enough when it came to her alone, when I arrived and said ""I can't do it anymore, I need to focus on my life, can you help me?"" she began to criticize everything, including the ""lack of attention"".

\- Sometimes I question why I keep living a life of being nice to people, and I always come to the same conclusion: I drown myself in people and their problems so I don't take things for myself. I let things go until they become unbearable to the point where I withdraw from everyone and need time to hang out with people.

\- I'm not well, I don't know when I'm going to ""be well"" and not even what the life I didn't expect to have but I'm living will be like.

I know who I want to be, I want to feel represented by being me day by day, and I will try to have a life that I want and allow myself. Things are going to be okay, and they're going to work out, one way or another. It's okay to be alone because I want to take care of myself. Finish college. Focus on career. Build the projects that I left so much idle. Maybe one day I'll love who I am, but until then, I'll remember to be more affectionate with myself.

I'm the goofy character that recurs on a sitcom once or twice a season and says a few quippy things before departing. But the character doesn't really add any value to the life or plot of the main characters. If I'm not there in an episode of someone's life, I'm not a noticeable omission. Nobody would even give a crap. I'm not anyone's favorite character and nobody knows, or cares, who I really am as a character. Nobody would want to come to me for advice. No one will notice when I'm visibly upset or down. It's made me close myself off even more as I've accepted the role I have.",JE1331,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tthenq/im_just_a_side_character/

I am so utterly exhausted of having to be alive. I can understand how painful it would be for my loved ones if I left but Im suffering.

My life is a wreck in general and it's feeding into my professional life, work from home (while not every day) is also making it worse as I can't distinguish between work and home life.

"I hate to live anymore, I just can't","Hey, um, there are so many things in mind to say but I can't, I can't think of what to say, I feel so scared to look people in the eye or just look at them and talk I can't talk to them.(so if anything goes wrong down, I'm extremely sorry)

I don't know where to start, but I feels like to just say everything that I've been burying in me so, 3 years back  so many things happened with me that I just couldn't feel anything I didn't want to feel anything, that betrayal, guilt, heartbroken everything was too overwhelming I couldn't bear that anymore so I tried to kill myself, I survived but kept doing it again and again even now sometimes, when things gets worse, 
Anyway so I couldn't bear all those things and then after some time  my results (of secondary high school) came in which I didn't score well atleast not what I wanted to score it really felt bad cause I really prepared so hard like I always used to study for almost 10-12 hours, I did everything I could possibly do, and on the exam day while giving it I had those nervous breakdown and all of a sudden I couldn't think of anything anymore I felt so scared that I screwed up everything so when my results came, the thing that hurted me most was that my parents when I needed them the most were just all angry on me they were just thinking about their pride and honour that they'd now have to lie to society that I scored well, all I wanted that time was their bloody support, was that too much to ask for? 

And after that I was so numb, broken that I again tried to jump off my building but couldn't do it I was sitting at the safety boundary wall looking down but couldn't jump as if I was too scared, and after that I just cut off all my ties with the world, I didn't talked to any of my friends or anyone, literally didn't stepped out of my house and my room for months I felt really broken 
And I stopped feeling anything eventually, it felt great I thought I founded a loophole in it but didn't knew I was just making it worse, and when now I'm supposed to pass out from (high school) and I have screwed up everything by this time, I can't focus on my studies I feel so alone I can't even tell, someone said that I should get some new friends, and I did it , I was too scared to go to real world so I went online, I did found some and for few days I really felt good but then again I came to square one like I'm just reliving my past in a loop and everytime I hurts more and more, I just can't think of anything anymore

And that's it, I guess I couldn't tell everything even if I wanted to like I told I just don't know how to say things which are in my mind 
And I wasted your time I'm really really sorry.
I just don't know where to go, to belong.",Garvaansh,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tu0fxq/i_hate_to_live_anymore_i_just_cant/
Morning is always the dangerous time,"Woke up to news that a check I wrote was taken out of my account twice. Grateful that I had the funds to absorb that error on the bank’s part but I’m irritated that it happened: how does that even happen. Take the money out one day and then lalala let’s take it out again the next day. The bank’s extremely unfunny idea of an April fools joke? 

I feel like every morning is a crap shoot on how I will feel. And my mind is doing its usual hijinks that I have to fight against. Or what if I don’t? What if I just say ok this happened; it doesn’t have to ruin my whole day. But I don’t have a good way to deal with anger so I guess the easiest thing is to turn it inward. 

My plan for April is to write 750 words every day and of course my stupid password is wrong. I sometimes hate electronics and the exhausting challenge it is to keep on top of the details. 

But again this seems like really crappy thinking. Or at least thinking that isn’t going to get me very far. I’ll go shower and see if I can get my brain in a different spot.",musical_froot_loop,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttroov/morning_is_always_the_dangerous_time/

I can’t hold out much longer,"(TW: self harm) I’ve been depressed since I was 7. I wrote a note to my mom telling her I tried to drown myself in the bathtub. Then started the therapists and psychiatrists. I’ve been on any drug you can think of, and nothing helps. I can’t do Ketamine because marijuana made me psychotic and I can’t do that again. 

My relationship is failing and it’s all my fault. The pandemic started a year after we started dating and I just succumbed to my depression. He constantly says he just wants me to come back and that he feels alone. My family had an intervention for me a few weeks ago, telling me they’re worried I’m going to end it all. That I seem like a zombie. That I don’t enjoy living. That I don’t want to try to enjoy living. The same day my boyfriend told me he can’t do this forever. 

Now I feel like I’m trying to hold on to something that will inevitably be taken from me. Why try? Half an hour ago he said the past two years will be nearly impossible to overcome. Why should I try? I haven’t wanted to cut myself so badly in a very long time. I could do it on my leg and he would never see it, because it’s not like we have sex anymore. No one would know. At the same time, if I do cut myself and he finds out, that will be another nail in the coffin. 

My parents say they would pay for me to go to a nice retreat-like inpatient facility. I told them I would never go back to a hospital program. 

I don’t want to go anywhere. I want to stay here, under the covers, with my blackout curtains, and a pair of scissors.",itslexyo,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttzp9p/i_cant_hold_out_much_longer/
Feeling like an imposter or faker all the time.,"One of the biggest things that haunts me with feeling depressed is the utterly suffocating feeling of being convinced that I’m faking it for attention. I don’t know if other people get this at all, which is kind of why I’m here sharing this to see if anyone else relates, but it’s constant alongside being depressed for me. Every morning the first or second thought that comes into my head is “you’re faking it for attention and sympathy”, when I have literally been to therapy/am going to be potentially medicated for my mental health this week. I’ve had high functioning depression for a while now, probably since around late 2020, but since the start of 2022 it turned into ‘not getting out of bed and starving myself’ depression. That’s when I started convincing myself I’m actually just a horrible lazy person who has no ambitions so tries to blame it on depression. It’s like I’m my own worst enemy and it’s exhausting. I always describe it as having multiple people in my head all the time arguing with each-other, and I can actually hear them arguing. 

I don’t know if anyone else ever feels like this with depression, but I really hope someone does, I think I’m just looking for someone to relate to really.",ezzaberry15,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttkxtp/feeling_like_an_imposter_or_faker_all_the_time/

I think my mom is depressed,"Hi, idk if this is the right subreddit for this but I just need advice.

Just for a little info: my mom has thyroid problems and one of its symptoms is depression.  Her depression come and go throughout the past years and I think it's coming back again.

I haven't seen her much the past few days because aside from me being busy with school, she's back to on-sight work (after working from home the past 2 years because of the pandemic.)

She comes home tired and goes straight to sleep, she then wakes up the next morning and goes to work.

The last time I talked to her, she seemed really sad-- she was speaking in a really quiet voice, almost whispering, and she just didn't seem to have any energy.  She's been like that the past week.  My aunt also told me how my mom cried because she said she's always tired and hungry and that she's getting sick and no one seems to care.  And now I think it's only gonna get worse now that my dad's shift is graveyard so he's not gonna be home every night.

Also, the last time we talked, she was going on about how gloomy our house looks-- like the lights are so dim and how empty the house looks as if no one lives in it. So today, I took a break from studying to change the light bulbs and rearrange the furniture, she seemed a little uplifted when she got home and saw it.  We then watched a movie and she seemed okay until after the movie when she said good night to me and my siblings and her voice was back to that sad quiet voice.

I don't really know what else I could do to help.  What should I do?

Not at risk,"I’m not at risk or anything so there may be someone else who needs help, please keep scrolling im more here to ramble about my feelings. 

So, I’m reaching a point in my life where people are throwing me around, or taking advantage while also pushing me away. 

Firstly, my family seem to take advantage of me for their own gain, for example; they ask to lend money constantly and rarely pay it back. I lent my dad money for a whole car and he still hadn’t paid me back, almost a year later. My mum constantly lends money then gets angry when I ask for it back, same with the rest of my family. 

I used to be in therapy/ on anti depressant tablets (Flux -&gt; sertraline) but the people who were helping me have completely shut me off. I’m from the UK and the company is called Chams (I think that’s how it’s spelt) they work with the NHS to give therapy and other mental/medical help. And I’ve been thrown away, I’ve been trying to get back into contact with them but they keep saying “we’re busy right now” or “we’ll set a date to meet” then the date comes and they’re suddenly busy again. Mainly due to “my age hitting a cut off point” meaning they don’t help people my age… which is stupid as I’m (for saftey I won’t link my real age) 18-25 so I’m pretty young yet they’ve thrown me aside for younger poeple. I’ve stated to them in person, they’ll only help me if I say I’m gonna KMS (as that’s what happened before) I was on a waiting list and they bumped me up due to trying to end my life… it was just something that they do, pushing risk people up… but sure I’m not at risk but surely my life still matters.

I'm scared to go on antidepressants,"So I recently broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years. It wasn't mutual at all. He left me and I begged him not to but ultimately he did.  

He was one of my biggest supporters and motivated me to get better. Infact I was starting to turn things around. I know now that the pressure of basically being responsible for someone else's life at age 18 was just too much for him. It was unfair for me to ever make him my reason to live. I need to do it for me.

But now my depression is worse then ever and the fact I have so few friends doesn't make it any easier. I've finally gotten my therapy refferal through after a year and should be starting soon but I feel that I may need an antidepressant to give me a little motivation
 

It terrifies me that I may work on myself and get myself to such a strong place, where I don't need to be emotionally dependent on people, and when I reach out to my ex he may not want the healed version of me. But I'm even more terrified the anti-depressants won't work or will make me gain weight (I have a history of eating disorders)

"Just tired, want to breath normally once again","Hey guys, never thought of posting this. But today it was the limit for me. Just wanted to know what you guys think. Almost nothing has been right with me since 2020, i have been waiting and working to get it all fixed but somehow, i managed to fuck it all up. It’s a long narration of what has been happening. It is a longass post pls be patient.

Till 2020 i was a college going bloke, had a lot of friends, opportunities. In march colleges were shut due to the pandemic. Hence I thought its a good opportunity to learn skills to get a better job. I was one of the top guys in college who a lot of people thought would do something big. Juniors liked me, and i guided them a lot. I was one of the popular kids, you would say. I participated in one hackathon, we reached the finals. Although we didn’t win, it helped me land an internship, which payed me the money i never imagined i would be earning at that time (almost 5x the amount i was expecting, i live in india and landed an internships in UK). Things were good.

Initially since i was new at job, and my friends didn’t have one yet, I was a bit busier. I genuinely tried to make it whenever they were catching-up online to play some amongus and skribble, but not every time. After sometime they stopped inviting me, thats alright, i don’t mind it. I was not able to catchup with friends very often, but i tried to whenever i could. 

It was September 2020 already and we saw no chance of colleges re opening anytime soon. We were 4 flatmates, and we decided that we will vacate the place we were living in at the time of college, we were in our final year. One of our common friends was bringing his car to pick us up, but since it was covid, there were restrictions so only 4 could go. I wanted to go, but since everyone wanted to get out of their houses, i backed out. So i told them that whatever expenses they do their i will give /5 of the money as my contri, just shift my stuff, everyone agreed. When they reached there everyone backed out of touching my stuff. My roommate, and best friend at the time shifted his, as well as my stuff. But he had to visit his sister who lived there, so he loaded up my stuff and left to meet her. The other 3 guys meanwhile sold more half of my stuff which was loaded and kept the money.  This stuff included some personal and emotional stuff i was attached to. My roomie when he returned, noticed this, but those guys gave him some part of the money they just made and told him to send it to me, saying that we sold some broken and junk stuff. My roomie told me this, I was furious at first, but calmed down, since I didn’t knew what were the things they sold(which i later found out were my books, my 6 pairs of shoes, my study table, my bed, my spare suitcase, my old monitor, and a statue of budhha, which was a gift). When i confronted them about this, they told me that they kept some commission (yeah 90% of the amount was those asshole’s commission). But they never did. I was not sad about the money, i was sad because i was cheated for some mere bucks by two of my best friends. The friendship ended. My roomie was still a friend tho.

March 2021, now everybody in my friend circle had a job, we were busier. But they managed to catchup every now and then, but i was never invited, i knew nothing of such catchups, i wanted to meet them, laugh with them. They did trips and planned them right infront of me, when i volunteered to go, they would cancel the trip. Then two days later i would see them on Instagram going for a trip, when asked i wanted to go too, they always said things along the lines of “it all happened so quickly, we just packed and left, we forgot to tell you”. This happened like 6 or 7 times. My friends forgot about me, getting cut off in conversations, plans, getting called an idiot for trying to make stupid jokes to make them laugh, getting called a simp for helping one of my female friends to get home, getting gaslighted when suggesting ideas. Once i remember that we needed to go for some official work together, it was raining cats and dogs that day. Work was important we had to go, but everyone was wearing new clothes and didn’t wanted to get wet. So i decided that i will get an auto (tuk-tuk)  so that we can get there. I was soaking wet within seconds, it took me 10 minutes to get an auto, i was shivering of cold but got an auto to pick them up, i went back to where they were, they were gone, i called them. Found out they book a cab while i was not there, and told me to get an auto here (bitches didn’t even try to call me once to let me know, or take me with them)
When reached there, i was laughed at for being soaked, they called it my bad luck. Since i was wearing white, and i am brown in complexion(you can call it black), one of my dear friends tried to be funny and called me a chessboard. I am unfortunately very insecure about my color, people try to use it to make fun of me, a thing i was not responsible for. On our way back, one of us was getting an insta story of us in a car, waving, when it was my turn to wave, one of them told me to shut up and tell the cab driver the directions. I lost it and angrily told him to be in his limits, he was wrong, still everybody took his side and told me that i was a buzzkill. 

We had a college party planned, since i had a position in planning board, it was up to us to decide wether we keep alcohol or not. Half of the board said to keep it , half didnt. I was the tie breaker, i kept trust and said that we should. This college party was our farewell, and some people got drunk, some puked. It was the decision of the board to include drinks, but i felt everyone was blaming me. I took some guys who were dead drunk and dropped them home. Didnt ate food that day. I never had so many people blaming me for anything i didnt do, i was shivering breathing heavily, i felt extremely cold, i was crying. It was the limit

The Day i almost died,"So on Friday my mother brought me to the doctor because I was unconscious again and had seizures when I woke up in the hospital was just the doctor asked me how I'm doing and so and has said to me that this dose would have almost killed me if I were not here and then I just explained everything to him as it started with the consumption and he just said that I absolutely need help Psychische / mental and absolutely must come down from this high dose and must make a therapy against addiction or I would not survive until the end of the year. He even wanted to send me into a coma if I had been unconscious for 5 minutes longer.

So that to my intoxication problem

Now I'm mentally bad as well as psychologically I'm completely down and again empty I have no more go, so often tried and fought against it and always fallen deeper.

More and more sadness is building up in my chest and is affecting my dreams as well as waking up but not being able to move. 

My seizure traps have also gotten worse and now come uncontrollably. 

But yes that was my little update I try then somehow to seek help even if it will not bring anything after my experience but what does one not do for his family, the dose I have also reduced from 310mg to 210mg and have to fight just blatant but it goes I try to get away from it completely because it does not help me anymore it makes me more sad and depressed that I get suicidal thoughts.",querox__,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttq8m5/the_day_i_almost_died/

Need Advice for how to get alprazolam prescribed,Hello like the title says I need some advice.  I'm a 25 year old male. Currently on suboxone and smoke carts but that's it.  I feel like I sufer from anxiety but I also feel like it's a waste of time to go to the dr being I'm already on suboxone because I know its basically impossible to get both.  I have albinism so my eyes aren't the best so I can't drive and I always have to rely on someone taking me to handle what I need to do.  I also have a mother whose in a wheelchair and on oxygen so I'm constantly doing things for her.  I feel like I'm always mad/ depressed and angry.  I' feel like I'm always trapped physically and mentally. I hardly have anyone I associate with except a guy I've been friends with since grade school who helps me out some when I need a ride or something. I feel like my life's going no where at the moment. Also I think I have some social anxiety because I absolutely hate going places like Walmart or somewhere I feel like being albino I'm always being stared at. Sometimes it's to the point I'd rather just not go and order whatever online. I always worry and overthink about the smallest things.  I get hung up worrying about something that doesn't even matter.  Something good can be planned and I think of 100 things that can go wrong. I've had several people tell me I have anxiety just because replies to text messages I've sent. The thing is I really have nobody I can talk to.  Me and my parents are close but they're just not the type you open up to.  I know alprazolam helps being I was able to get farmapram for about a year and it basically made my life do a 180 when I was taking it but my vendor disappeared and I don't take presses and pharma grade is non existent.  I had no social anxiety I wasn't nervous about going out I was always happy never angry.  I just need some help guys.  Sorry for the rant.

Everything went ok like any conversation at the beginning. The problem is that suddenly without saying something wrong or doing something she feels distant from me.

I kept thinking if I was the problem, if I did something wrong, if I didn't do something right, but I can't understand.

i tend to have depressing internal dialog. any suggestions or help?,"I am 28M. And I think i might be people pleaser. I generally the class clown of the social settings. I go to meetups to meet people in hopes of making friends and maybe eventually  find a girlfriend (idk how but i am following internet advices) I like to make people laugh and be cheeky with people) But since I don't want to come off as ignorant, I try to know historical, geographical, cultural etc aspects of different countries. Like for eg. I try to learn about Nicolae Ceausescu who was communist dictator in Romania, so if I meet a Romanian girl or a guy I have something else to talk about other than draculas. I am single so i hope to find a girlfriend soon, so i try to impress them with playful  banter or talk about something new i read about the country. Like I heard German girls like talking about politics, history, so i started watching videos about Prussia and unification of Germany as country. People enjoy conversation with me. But eventually i run out of things to say and i can often see they get bored. 

And i start having internal dialog, :""Think about something to keep them interested "" and then when they talk with someone else, i feel like a failure. I see other people always have something not talk about and are interesting.

I make people laugh, mostly it works, but then if a girl doesn't laugh or she starts being indifferent to you and open up her phone.
I have internal dialog ""Not that funny, be interesting"".

Even meeting people who says they have a girlfriend makes me depressed, like i am 28 , how the f**k i don't a girlfriend and this person is being engaged. I feel left behind.

Given my shitty childhood , I am only good at humor. I think making someone laugh not only makes me feel good, it makes others smile. (Some don't like funny people, presumption being funny people are dumb and not sophisticated )
I am in a foreign country , working a decent job, but i have responsibility towards my parents back home. I am not financially well off to travel and do awesome things that seems to keep people interested especially girls.

People say you don't need others approval , live life that fits you. But if I do that how would I know i am not alienating others and making them frustrated. And they will eventually discard me.

No self esteem. I feel this deep sadness inside of me, it consumes me and it is so strong. I just want to disappear.

I see no purpose in my life. I don't think I'll ever get better before I confront my family. Though I know if I do this my brother will punch me because that is what he does.

I am not in contact with him or my mother. I don't even hate them. I am too miserable to do that. I just wish it got better, I am so sad. So miserable. If I were to die tomorrow I'd be okay with it. I wouldn't have to suffer anymore.

The nurse who cared and loved me.,"Last night I spoke to the widow of one of the most important people who supported me during the darkest hours of my life.

I always know how sincere he was and how much he tried to make me feel important and loved. But I cannot reciprocate his feelings towards me and yet he continued to talk to me and share moments of his life. Like he wanted to remind me how I was missing out on life. 

He will travel around his neighborhood while I was on video calls. I can feel his intention to make me feel better. Even tho he knew that my relationship with him will never go beyond friendship. 

He was there to watch me over and make sure that I will never do something that can harm me. I can only recall the video calls where he used to show bridges and restaurants. My memory is not still not vivid until now.

I never really asked for someone to watch me over like that. We never lost contacts until he finally found a girlfriend that he eventually married. He was so happy and excited about his relationship and he always loved sharing it with me.

After a year or so, I received a message from him and it was his partner. I was told that he was gone.

I just lost my dad and receiving that kind of mesaage had wrecked me more. 

I looked through my conversations with him and I notice that, I was not really there. I was so depressed that I was not really there.

Spirituality?,"So I’m currently extremely depressed, I can’t go to school and I don’t know if I will graduate. My depression has been getting worse and worse progressively, I have been on 5 different medications but I can’t manage to feel better. 

In different occasions my mother has blamed me for this, because she says I’m “walking away from God”. She says that all of those who are suffering it’s because they have turned their back to God. She isn’t even a practicing catholic, she doesn’t go to church, she only prays when she needs it. 

I’m agnostic, even though I was baptized and was forced to make my first communion. I feel like it’s absurd to relate mental illness, scientifically proved and researched etc. etc. with religion, but I wanted to ask you all, what are your thoughts on spirituality and religion in relation to depression? 
Does believing in God has helped you in any way? Or if you don’t believe in God, does spirituality makes part of your life? 

Oh and my mother forced me to join a catholic support group to make me socialize. My parents believe that even though I’m not a devout Catholic it could be useful to surround myself with people with different perspectives of the world or something.

Chronic overthinking and procrastinating- should I try ssri‘s?,"I had issues concentrating all my life. Daydreamed my life away.

Later in my teens, I think from 17 on (early 2000‘s), I spent way too much time with just doing nothing. Before laptops it was the TV or just laying on the couch and scribbeling nonsense. After that it was the laptop. Then the phone. 

I really have goals in my life since back then, but I’m not doing anything to achieve them, cause I end up in bed or on the couch again. 
Always saying I’m going to start the next day, but never doing. For that many years.

Cheating is inevitable.,"Throughout my life experiences I have come to the conclusion that cheating is inevitable. I have been cheated on in every single serious relationship I've ever had. Especially with the last girl I tried doing everything I could to help her and to be a blessing in her life but that doesn't work. I tried everything I could. It's sad because I have realized that no matter what I do, what changes I make, or who I become I will always, ALWAYS be cheated on in some way shape or form. Everyone is ran by their egos in this generation. Especially the weak ones, they fall to temptations easily. The moment they are presented with something that is in some way shape or form ""better"" than what they have they will always take it. There's always someone better. Because once you get close to a person they see who you truly are. They see your weakness. And once they find someone who   doesn't appear to have the weakness they will always go for it. There is absolutely nothing, NOTHING YOU CAN EVER DO TO KEEP THE ONE YOU LOVE. Most people don't even have the common sense to think to themselves, what will this do to my significant other? Why do I feel the need to cheat? And none of them will ever realize how weak and broken they are. The truth is if you cheat, help a person cheat or anything along those lines, if you have the audacity to disrespect someone like that you are instantly less than anyone who has not cheated. Who has not fallen to that temptation. 

Im going solo now. Im not wasting time with another person. My time is too valuable to be wasted on these pathetic people. From the pain that I have been through, through all that I have endured I have become incredibly self aware of how and why people act the way they do. It's easy for me to see now. Relationships in this generation will never work. Cheating is too common. Hookup culture is a thing. And most will not hesitate to disrespect you and cheat on you the moment they feel sexual temptation. And oh boy if your in a relationship and they keep anything from you. Well you have your answer. There's nothing you can do to stop it.",krisal_,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttek4j/cheating_is_inevitable/

"I did really well for 3-4 days in my life, I put a lot of grief behind me, but after a few days, that state was gone, the sadness and the grief Just took over again.","I don't have anyone to talk to so I'll just write my thoughts here. This is gonna be a long read. 

I'm in 12th grade. This entire year(March 2021- current day), I've been sad on most days, I was mostly unproductive, I felt like time was slipping by and I just needed to study, which I just couldn't do, I wasted almost all my days but I was always sad, I was slightly suicidal in March but June-September were days when I thought about dying everyday, but I just couldn't do it, and my days kept passing by, the sadness was always there, the suicidal feelings came and went by. I'm thankfully not suicidal anymore.
 
I was really unhappy with my relationship with my father too, my marks weren't that good and he used to shout loudly at me whenever I came by to have lunch(he's a stay at home dad and a really good husband to my mother), whenever I tried to laugh in front of him, he used to remind me of how I fucked up my grades.

I even tried to tell them I am having these thoughts, back in June, but my father basically told me how ""you need to have a family atleast to be depressed. It's not your fault, it's my fault. I should have beaten u up before u became somebody like this."" Whenever he used to see anything related to depression or suicide in the news, all he would do is mock those people, call them cowards and curse at them, a lot of times in front of me, I don't think it was intentional, but it definitely hurt me.   Gradually I started hating him, but deep down I know he loves me, and on some level maybe I do too, but sometimes I make up these scenarios or fantasies inside my head when  I'm just shouting and cursing at him, for more that 15-20 mins, sometimes about beating him up. This is really conflicting, and honestly I sometimes feel guilty for being like this, I want to move away from him someday, just maintain a proper distance or maybe not even see him anymore, but I always feel guilty even when I think about it, I don't have any siblings, all they've got is me. On the other hand, my father is so protective, he wants me to do an arranged marriage in future, I reside in India, it's a common practice here, but I just want to do whatever I want, with my life, as long as it doesn't impact anybody else. I've been having fights with him from a long time now, I say some bad things to him sometimes, but most of the times I try to keep my mouth shut. I'm moving out in 80 days, to prepare for a good college, I'll have to drop this year to prepare. It's my last chance to get into a good college, in a country like India.

So, jumping back to the present days now. I'm all alone here in this house with my parents, I've got my annual exams coming up, plus I'm preparing for the college entrances, basically covering up as much syllabus as I can before my drop year, before moving out to study at a city. I had to shift to a new place about 70 days ago, I had to leave the place and the people I actually grew up with. They weren't the best people and I didn't have that deep friendship with anybody, I had developed an intense limerence on this girl tho, she was my classmate. But I didn't want to make it awkward, we were good friends, why risk it, and we were just kids, we've got our careers in front of us, but ofcourse the pain is always there. Teenage sucks in general I guess. I won't write much about this but this was a primary reason for my sadness too, I feel ashamed and stupid being sad about something that didn't even exist, my relationship with her.

So, I moved away, and I was really really grieving almost every day, for losing her, losing everybody, I don't have anyone here, and combine this grief with all the stress that's been going on, it's a recipe for disaster. I was suicidal for a while, but mostly I've just been sad. I've been trying my best to study hard, and i lost a lot of days, just lying in bed, and hating myself for it. 

I woke up in the morning 7-8 days ago, and that pain was just gone, I barelyly missed anyone, I barely missed her, I was literally hugging my pillow in bed and crying while talking to it, pretending it's her, that was the level of my obsession, just a week ago, and suddenly everything was just gone. Coincidentally, or maybe not, I had a good day of studying that same day, and the next one was the same, yesterday was the good too, I didn't have perfect days, but I was able to achieve all daily goals.

I felt like I got over all this shit, I felt like I am actually in control, I felt like I'm actually maybe becoming an adult, learning to control my emotions. On the other hand, I also thought that maybe I was never mentally ill, I was just sad I guess. I was just emotionally immature maybe. On the other hand, I was afraid that hopefully I'm not going emotionally numb, I was afraid that I won't be able to feel anything at all, since these feelings had gone away. But I actually had some decent days, I really enjoyed listening to my favorite songs in this period too.

But then came that day, I had my daily goals prepared, the day started good. I was solving some physical chemistry questions in the noon and the long decimal calculations always bother me, and take me out of the subject. I got bored and instead of changing the subject, I made the mistake of watching TV, while having lunch, my parents were out of town today. And this way I wasted my entire time till the evening on reddit and watching some TV, etc. Then came the evening, and the sadness completely took over, the bad feelings just coming back. now I feel like what if it was just a dream like state, what if I slide back to my old habits? I've had relapses in the past, and I've lost up to 10-14 days without studying, after that, I can't afford to lose that much time at this point.

The other thing that I feel bad about is that for the past six months or so, I had this feeling that maybe...maybe I am mentally ill, but at the same time I felt like what if I'm just using this as an excuse to not do shit. Now due to this event, I feel like maybe I was in control all the time, I could have been happier, I could have just done my job I guess, but I didn't, and I'm 100% responsible for it. Maybe I am just an emotionally immature piece of shit whose laziness caused him to be sad for so long.

Now it's been 4-5 days since I wrote this on r/mentalhealth. The sadness just doesn't go, and I don't even understand what's happening. My feelings for her are back too, with the same intensity. I'm still partially productive which is a good thing I guess, but the sadness just doesn't go away... I don't even cry these days, I feel like I'm converting it into some kind of imaginary anger, which I make sure never gets out. All of it, the sadness, the anger, everything is just gone whenever I'm with my family. It's like I can put on this mask of happiness, of laughs, in just a matter of seconds. Sometimes I feel like am I really sad, or am I faking it all?

A letter to my father who passed last year.,"Dear Papa,

I am finally recovering for a little bit now.  
I am so sorry that I was not emotionally there when  you were sick. 
I am sorry that I was not the person that you always dreamed me to be.

I remember those times that we were endlessly talking about the origin of the universe, what kind of matter is DNA and how it contains so many information about how everything should function, the random argument about what ice cream is the best to buy at 3am in the morning, and so many other things that only you and me can understand. 

I woke up last night and I felt so numb. My dream was blank and my brain is trying not to process that you are not here anymore. I want talk to you but there is no technology to reach you out. I can't help myself but to feel the pain inside  my stomach and chest that the only way to release it is to cry it all out.

It feels so strange that I have a very delay reaction. My memory is still fuzzy and it feels blank at the back of my head until now.  I am so thankful that I found a very special person who shares the same strenght that you had. 

I remember how we used to cruise along the stinky local market roads and buy bunch of random cheap things like as if we won the lottery. I love thinking about those times and how simple things were. I will always remember your smile and how much you keep on telling me to understand and forgive than to hate. 
You are the only one that keeps my temper down. I was never a calm person but you made me understand why  people who hurt you the most are the same people who truly needed you the most. Like a cry for help. Everyone is telling me that I used to be a very brave kid, that I can go through difficult things. But sometimes, It is not really easy anymore. 

I am sorry for failing you. I can only promise to myself, my daughter and the one that I am with that I won't miss any day to celebrate life.",AranyCynarA,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttpss2/a_letter_to_my_father_who_passed_last_year/

30 and ready to check out,"Life started off amazing. I enjoyed playing football (soccer) being social and having an amazing normal childhood. I had a decent amount of friends. Suffered childhood bullying like we all do but nothing major. Enjoyed school though was academically uninterested. Had dreams and aspirations like we all had but they were crushed when I turned 16 and had my first drink. 14 years later I've completely ruined my life, have no job, no house, live with my parents, suffer from bi polar disorder, completely cut myself off from the world, no motivation to even get up most days, I'm confined to my room for the majority of my pitiful existence. This year I decided to try and get sober and turn things around and I'm 4 months in and even more miserable than I was when I was fucked out my head, at least the hangovers took my mind off this shitty existence. I've burned bridges with most people I know, I've tried faith but it's just not there for me unfortunately I don't think I could even be arsed with an afterlife either if I'm honest. If truth be told even though I'm suicidal the thought of slitting my wrists seems such a chore and a hassle and no doubt I'd probably fuck it up and have everyone worried and then I'd end up sectioned and have to deal with the outside world asking me fucking questions and pretending they give a fuck haha I constantly think about death, dying, suicide, ways of how to commit suicide then I think about my parents and think fuck and call it off as I know my death would kill my mother which obviously I don't want.

for starters, I don’t have any sob story really. I have everything to be thankful for, and I am. Lately what Has been aching me… Is myself.

I am only 18, but I don’t know how to drive, I dropped out of high school, and although I have multiple passions, I’m horrible at consistency and can barely chase them. I feel like I’m not doing enough and that I don’t deserve the gifts that I’ve been born into because of my sin (im not religious). My wrath, my sloth, my lost, greed, gluttony, envy, pride, For some reason I really hyper focus on what ranges from small habits or slip ups to, at least to me, considerably unforgettable things and thoughts.

I’ve been told exactly what anyone in my situation would always want to hear, and yet I feel like the very next moment I take everything for granted. I just feel so useless and direction less. Hell I even feel bad for complaining about this seeing my situation isn’t all that bad compared to y’all.

I don’t know, I suppose I’m just rambling. I’ll just wait for this to get taken down or something. But before that, does anyone else get this feeling?

As I have been thinking, maybe it's time to try some approaches if I want to get better. I'm having trouble coping these days because I just sleep all day long and starve myself if I'm having days off.

Probably this is the third time just in case Quora’s answers aren’t super helpful at the moment. God, why’s Quora not good for these kinds of questions?

Anyway, I watched too many films in the past, including the 2006 film “Idiocracy.” I can’t get over the fact that it’s so goddamn accurate if I compare it to our world. It’s so messed up, I don’t recommend anyone to watch it again.

Because of that damn film, I don’t know what’s real anymore. I don’t know who I was anymore. I don’t know why I get bad damn news every single month. I feel like living in the world like in movies would be so much better for me.

I have been able to deal with it somewhat with the support of my mother. My mother died, which severly aggrivated my situation. I was diagnosed with severe depression, but i declined pursuing medication, since i will have periods of feeling brilliant and conversely horrible and that steep drop is just the worst.

When that steep drop happens, i do things i later come to regret. Things such as trying drugs hoping it would change my circumstance. That has been easy to come to terms with, because i havent touched any again and it is what it is. However, Yesterday i did something far more severe. I paid for sex. I did regret it immediately and walked out after like 10 minutes, but it still happended. 

I just cant see myself being able to move on from this. I feel absolutely disgusted with myself, but what pains me the most is knowing that this will always define what kind of a man i am and if i ever improve my mental state and meet someone special, i will have to try and explain what i have done.

Sorry if this is not the right subreddit, i just feel so hopeless and i was hoping someone perhaps have experienced the same or something similar. I just cant see any way past this or how i can learn to live with it.",AnyRock7416,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttnwrd/coming_to_terms_with_bad_decisions/

why can't I give a shit? an apathetic tragedy,"I have found the love of my life, we went almost 6 years strong, engaged, adopted a whole litter of cats. We grew together from kids into adults. It was great. Then the monotonous set in... work, home, work, home.... we started drifting. I saw it, she saw it. Neither one of us said a word. But it was ok because we still had those moments where that spark came back, but fluttered just as fast as it came. It was ok because she's my person. My side kick,  I knew we were gonna have bad days. It was the bad months that got me. I ended up venting to some one, and the coffee led to wine,  and the wine led to, well the other stuff. I knew it was wrong while I was doing it. I knew. I just was sitting in the passenger seat watching some one else drive my body and mind. It went on for a few months. We'd only talk about once or twice a month, to me it was therapeutic to just have some one outside of your home to talk to, to give a shit. But she caught feelings much harder then I ever anticipated.  So I broke things off. Vowed to myself that I'll do everything I can to make my true partner feel appreciated and adored. And to never stray outside my relationship again. I was true to my word, truly... but a day late and a dollar short. I get woken up to my S/O screaming at me. Saying she knew everything.  She kicked me out ( rightfully so), called me every name in the book. Fast forward a few days, she allows me to come over to talk. And we do. I'm sitting on what was once my couch and not once did I feel sorry for what I did. Because in my mind it was over and done with. I only wept because I saw all the trust this woman had for me dissolve. Knowing that it would never be the same. And yet, when I left,  I couldn't care.  I feel nothing except curiosity, no shame, no regret, no self hatred, no happiness. Just metaphorical white noise with the occasional internal question of future and self preservation. Here's the kicker. I want to feel bad. I want to hate myself. I want us to work. I don't want to lose her. But the second I'm not around her, that apathetic switch goes back on and I'm indifferent once again. No joy, no sorrow, just white noise...

I am not working constantly and when I am it’s cabinetry and I bores me so greatly. I am doing online school but there’s just nothing happening.

Depression is so humbling,"I’ve been having to redefine my ideas of success and truly ask myself which paths in life are best for my well-being. When the thought of going through the process of achieving some of my dreams makes me want to off myself, I really have to take a step back and ask if those dreams are worth it. Sometimes it’s been truly wanting to pursue them, other times it’s been having mentioned the dreams to others before and the embarrassment of not living up to the future I and others envisioned for myself.

I keep thinking back to when I was cutting. I no longer cut. But I’m also thinking of how I still struggle with thoughts of ending my life. Why in the world am I so soft in a world where softness cannot be afforded? Who am I to allow myself to be weak? And should I embrace it and find the path that allows me to live, or challenge myself even if it means I might end myself? 

Is it possible to find sweet, sweet balance where I accept my limitations as an individual living with this but don’t let go of the possibility that some dreams might still be attainable? That’s where I’ve found myself lately. I start my first job soon and while it’s not grad school, it’s still somewhat related to what I hoped to do. Will I go to grad school? I hope, but in all reality, just living itself is hard. I’m hoping to be able to make as much of a difference as possible, even if that difference doesn’t look like what I initially hoped it would.

how to tell whether i have a melancholic/dramatic personality or depression?,"i'm not sure whether i'm actually depressed or if i just naturally have a melancholic personality. my therapist thought i was depressed so i'm on anti-depressants now, but i don't know if i'm just being dramatic. i'm very very high-functioning, moreso than others i've known to have high-functioning depression.

the reasons i think i may not actually be depressed:

\- i can enjoy music, art, nature, movies, literature. i can appreciate beauty.

\- i can easily get out of bed

\- i do a lot of activities (and never back out from them) and like social interactions. i can be talkative around my friends sometimes

\- sleep is pretty good (i tend to take many naps throughout the day like i have trouble staying awake for more than 2-3 hours, a lot more than the average person, but perhaps i am just a sleepy person, also i've been like this since 7th grade)

\- motivated (go to top college and do decent amount of activities and get good grades, ambitious)

\- can get a lot of work done easily

\- good concentration/focus/high attention span. i enjoy math and logic.

\- some symptoms are situational/vary. for example, i regain my appetite when i leave college and go home. feel less sleepy sometimes. lethargy gets better sometimes.

\- not angry or irritable

////

the reasons why i might be depressed:

\- (one symptom that never changes) low self-esteem, sense of worthlessness, chronic feeling of being human trash and a burden to everyone i come across, always feeling like i'm doing something wrong, easily ashamed, always guilty, self-hatred, constantly criticizing myself, feel like a waste of flesh. never feeling like i'm doing enough, don't deserve kindness. But this might just be due to severe social anxiety which i've had since i was a child. also, i've felt this way about myself for as long as i can remember so it can definitely be a personality trait.

\- always feel like my head is being held under water or that i'm living behind a panel of glass watching the rest of the world pass by. i sometimes come out of this feeling and everything feels brighter and i can be present, but it usually doesn't last more than 2 days. however, this feeling has been here since like 5th grade so it might just be a personality trait.

\- persisting feeling of emptiness and detachment from the world. started when i was young but intensified over the years.

\- i have interests but they feel dull for most of the time. i don't genuinely enjoy them for most of the time. like i mentioned earlier, for the few times i feel as if my head is above water they feel so much more meaningful and bright and i can feel excited about them. they're alright though. but i've felt like this for years too since childhood

\- lack of appetite (this symptom varies. for example, some weeks i can't eat anything and drop a lot of weight, and for others i overeat, and for others i eat average amounts of food)

\- sleeping a lot, trouble staying awake for more than 2-3 hours (sometimes goes away on my good days) but again i might just be a lethargic person

\- persistent belief that it would have been better not to have been born (but goes away for a few hours sometimes)

\- escapism/fantasization addiction. cannot avoid feeling emptiness without it. (did since i was a child) but it makes my life feel colorful and gives me excitement.

\- self-harm (not that serious. only occasionally) i don't have anything sharp enough either so i don't ever bleed that much. i've been tempted to buy razors but i haven't.. but lots of fantasies of self-harm (this feeling goes away for a couple hours sometimes though).

\- trouble enjoying social interaction due to shame and self-criticism and withdrawal (likely could be social anxiety tho)

\- lethargy and fatigue and foggy head makes it difficult to work as hard as i would want to. but i still do okay so idk.

\- slow movements, heaviness and difficulty moving most of the time (might just be lazy and unfit though).

\- hopelessness of change. i don't believe this fog will ever lift. i know logically it can, but i have doubts. i feel like it's forever. this hollowness to the world. it's been there since i was little and i can cope with it.

\- general feeling that each day is a war

I miss depressions.,"That's it. I miss the emptiness and the sadness all the long hours of zoning out and simply and understanding true existential horror. All of the crisises I felt. I miss the isolating. I struggled with depression for 4-5 years and just in the past year I've began feeling GOOD. I've found motivation to take baths, go to works, see my friends go out and have a good time drinking. Yet I feel a part of me is lacking. I miss my alone times and my depression. I miss having long thoughts with nobody but myself and actually thinking about things. I feel a part of me deserves displeasure as almost a form of discipline, and I feel unchecked.

I hate just hate this world. Anyone agree?," It's like I'm truly lost. I don't know what to do with myself. I have so many dreams and ambitions but the more I think about them the further those dreams get away. Once those dreams fade away, new dreams come and the cycle repeats itself, but in the end I’ve made no progress. I’ve just been running still, chasing something that I didn’t want to put the effort in. When you learn the true secrets of this world you don’t even know if another day is what you want. I mean it all could be and probably is going to be meaningless in the end. Even if you impact the entire human race in the end that doesn’t even matter. While time flows you’re forgotten more and more by history until there are no humans left, by the time this galaxy becomes extinct and the whole universe crumbles. We know that this will happen far far far after we are already dead but why does it feel like it’s going to happen so soon? Why do I suffer like I’ve seen generations of loved ones get slaughtered right in front of me? Why is my first thought in the morning “fuck, I could’ve slept more” or “fuck, I want to sleep more”. Why is it that when I wake up that’s when the real nightmare begins? And why do I ask myself these questions every day? Why do I even worry about these things if I know it’s still going to be meaningless in the end. When I go out the only thing on my mind is “how do these other people think of me”. That is probably the same thing they are thinking to themselves at that very moment and that’s probably why when someone does something unordinary everyone is quick to judge because for a split second they don’t need to think about themselves but can judge someone else on how they are. We are so blinded about our self image and the importance of fitting in that we don’t even realize the small good things in life anymore. We only realize the bad things and I honestly can’t blame anyone for that. I mean society has made everything a living hell basically. For example, don’t you just get sad when you see a group of six to ten year old's standing around in a circle with all their necks in a 90 degree angle just looking at their own phones. How are those children even going to adapt and live in this hellhole that we’ve created for them? When you think about it technically it would be so easy to resolve this world by everyone working together, but because of pride and hunger for wealth we can’t just cooperate with each other.

"I'm a Hollow Shell of a Person, and I Hate my Self-Loathing","I seriously have lost so much, and it's all my fault. I turned 19 this month, and am thinking I am only regressing with time. I am on three separate meds for mental health (2 antidepressant, one stimulant) and still have depressive episodes almost regularly. My father belittles me, saying something along the lines of ""get your head out of your ass"" basically everytime I want to bring up a mental health concern. He's very fed up with me, and I feel horrible for being such a letdown. Being kicked out is inevitable, as my two older siblings left in a similar manner (one forced out, one left after an argument). It definitely doesn't help that my dad is strictly against mental health treatment.

My stepmother (birth mother died at a very young age), on the other hand, supports my pursuit for wellness. It is, however, a means to an end. She prides herself as a first-gen college graduate, and is kind of a tiger mom as a result. The only problem is that she entered my life when I was 9, and I actively rebelled against her  as a result. I would constantly find workarounds to her control, whether it be deleting parental control software, or masking my ip address regularly. This caused her to eventually ""give up"" on me, but she's  entered her old ways again by my consent throughout the pandemic.

 I am typing this on cellular data, since the router is now shut off every night at 10pm. It hasn't done much to fix my circadian rhythm, as I still stay up until 4am every night. My dad yells at me about this quality almost daily and my stepmother is disappointed, since it hinders my ability to succeed academically (shitty grades rn).  

I feel like something left me at some point, since I have achieved things when younger.  I hate how self-centered my thought processes have become, and how they only serve to beat me up. I'm only working 10 hours, and am basically not attending college anymore. I'm at an unnecessarily low point that I'm causing. It seems so easy to fix, though the only problem is that I can't get my head out of my ass. I am hopeless and I hate it. I become immobile when confronted, and it has only worsened conflicts that could be resolved with better placed words.

Anyway, thank you for reading my short essay draft about my life. This is probably tangentle, and hard to follow. I don't mind, and am just relieved to vent about something after so long. I hope I can get out of this trough and reach another peak, but I'm feeling less optimistic now.

Why is it so hard to be normal?,"I'm 25F and I still feel like I'm a teen who's heavily dependent on others and can't do things on my own without feeling like the world is ending. Why is even the bare minimum of socializing is so god damn difficult and tiring! I can't say or text someone a simple greeting without stressing the fuck out. I hate that I'm becoming more dead inside as time goes by. I want to be loved, to have friends, to have a ""life"", and to be happy but I can't have any of that when I barely leave my room. I can't talk like normal and my replies are mostly boring and often repeated words, and I can't keep a conversation going. I don't even put any effort into anything anymore. I graduated university 2 years ago and I still can't find a job. Honestly... I don't want to work, I don't want to leave my safe place, and I don't want to deal with people. I don't feel I'm competent enough to work. I'm tired of everything. I feel like I'm stuck in a time loop except everything and everyone else around me is moving forward with their lives. 

Sometimes I wish I died in that accident when I was 13 and not have lived and suffered through all these years. If only I wasn't a coward I would've freed myself years ago. 

I can't even get any professional help here. Majority of people in my country have extreme backwards views when it comes to mental health, to put it simply, if you are unwell mentally then you're probably not praying enough or you're possessed by a ghost or a demon. There are few therapists but they are far away and I wouldn't trust their expertise. I'm in no immediate danger and I don't self harm so don't worry too much about me.

**EDIT**: Thank you everyone for taking the time to hear me out :') I have read every single comment, and some of those comments described how I feel better than I could! 

This all feels like a dream.... like I don't deserve any of this kindness or attention. I don't usually let myself be this vulnerable, let alone to strangers on the internet, so I didn't expect this much support and I'm overwhelmed by it and it's nice to be heard and understood, and know that I'm not alone in feeling this way.

I was slowly starting but suddenly we had exams so I had to cram everything in just few hours in morning 2 am but outcome wasn't good and I was stressed bc of urgent cramming and all. As soon as I get back at track we had another exam and this cycle continued till Pre boards, now I'm barely passing or even failed in preboard. I got final exam in 20 days.

"Comfortable with death, thought of being dead terrifies me…","Slight backstory, I’m currently 22(f) and I’ve been diagnosed with depression, depression induced anxiety, stress, and so so much more since the very tender age of 14. 

I won’t go into my upbringing too much but it was rough. My mom had my phone turned off via the company every night at 9pm M-F and 10pm on the weekends because she thought I didn’t need to be talking to anyone nor did anyone need to be talking to me. It made me sneakier in my ways of messaging my friends but nonetheless my life was stressful since I was able to retain memory. Anyways, at 14 I discovered that self harm was the best relief I’ve ever been able to find. I’ve done the therapy, the pipe cleaners, I’ve done the talking, the pills, everything; the pills make me feel like a zombie, the talking makes me feel like my problems never end and they just keep on growing and taking on new shapes and forms, therapy makes me feel like they don’t understand anything i say, they just get paid to listen and give me a prescription to make a 90lb girl skip lunch and barely eats until she drops to lower than 80lbs…. Anyways nothing ever worked, except self harm… it just felt like this:

I would keep everything inside, bottled up. I would never talk about it and it would brew and brew and eventually I would just pop, I would have explode with emotions, I would get angry and break things, I would get sad and cry, then I finally settled with my old friend, depression… settling with this demon meant that nothing felt like I would be able to get out all the ickiness inside of me unless I bled… it was the only way it made sense in my head, the only way to truly feel better was to bleed out all the ick, want to hear the sad part? It actually worked…! Whenever I would self harm, I felt better than anything else I’ve ever tried. Anyhow, my mom found out, well the found the scars and asked if I was okay and I told her it was from the rabbits we had in the backyard… they bought it. 

I finally told them to take my keys away, this was after I had a meltdown. I told them I was going to crash my car into a tree full sped head on. (Fun fact: that’s my ideal suicide, I would crash my car and die) My father went through my journal and completely ruined my ability to do the second best thing I knew to do that helped; journal. He read all my entries and learned more about me than any father probably wanted to know. He grew to know me on a very personal level that day. He found out a lot of shit and they confronted me. It completely made me feel alone. I’ve never felt like I could trust anyone since. I can’t write things down anymore because if someone finds them, I’m ruined. I can’t journal because if someone knows your truly darkest moments and most vulnerable times, they store it and use it to ruin you, I can’t let anyone have that kind of access again. Never. 

Here we are present day. Like the header says, the thought of being dead is comforting rather than scary. It’s nice. It’s warm. It’s welcoming. It’s no judgement. It’s peace. It’s the silence in the storm. The thought of no longer being a burden, no longer causing ripples of pain, no longer having anyone clean up my messes, no longer feeling like a disappointment, no longer day after day being a failure, it’s no longer hurting, suffering, fighting, lying, masking, faking, etc. With death comes peace, tranquility, silence. When you die, you no longer have to live and that’s what I want most. For once I just want to feel something other than nothing. I feel nothing. I feel absolutely nothing. 

When I think about death, I think about being free but death comes with a price. That price, death eternal. Death forever. Death FOR EV ER! You cannot come back from death, it’s not a mini vacation, it’s not just something you can visit between realms or something. Death is infinite, endless, a void, a black hole. I believe that ghosts and spirits are real and we can come visit our loved ones but I want more than that. I want it all. I want everything. I want to see my brothers grow up. I want to see my parents happy. I want to see it all. I want to witness it all firsthand. I want to be there in the pictures. I don’t want to fade away and become a memory people visit sometimes. 

The thought of being dead isn’t scary, it’s the thought of never being able to come back that scares me. I want to live but I want to die all the same. I’m not mentally strong enough to fight these demons alone. I’m not strong enough to power through everyday. I fight the urge to get up everyday. I drag myself to work. I don’t enjoy life. I don’t do anything fun. I don’t do anything for myself. Just work and sleep. I don’t take care of myself. I barely brush my teeth, eat appropriately, or bathe regularly.

Before you judge me, just know that depression makes the bare necessities in life seem like so much work. They take so much out of you. Doing anything other than lying down seems impossible.

Apologies for the randomness 😨,"Hello to whomever runs into this, I'm 21 years old and im from Arizona. I was diagnosed with major depression a year ago along with anxiety PTSD, and disassociation. I've struggled with things since I was a child and my body had given up in 2020 which probably topped off all the ""this is the worst day of my life"" moments in my life and I'm sure others as due to the pandemic and other life situations. I don't have a stable support system at all, it tends to be like those Rollercoasters at six flags. I have time periods where I feel really ill from my disorders and it can last up to 3 weeks, I only recently since December had began to take showers again, I was so depressed it was hard to keep up with hygiene and self care in general. The shower use to be my happy and safe place, god the amount of times I was yelled at for spending too much time in there when all I could find was peace and comfort in it. Now it's become the most hardest and most annoying chore for me. I hope someone can relate and im sure there is. At this very moment I feel so lost, alone, suffocated, confused. I know it's my anxiety making me feel this way and my depression. Although my body is physically telling me that I'm going to be having thoughts soon again and I feel so lost and I am coming here to just idk im trying this out to see if there's someone out there idk who I could relate to?

I’ve snowballed myself into a situation I feel no way out of,"Im just venting here, I know there isn’t really much anyone can do to help me, I just need to get this off my chest. 
I don’t really have anyone in my life right now. I have a mother and sister, but we are not really on speaking terms aside from holidays — I’m the black sheep of the family. 
I don’t really have friends -all of my high school friends kind of separated and I have had an incredible hard time making new friends. 
Anyway, flash forward to now. I’m 24 and I thought I had finally got my life in order, and then Covid hit. 
I was bartending for a company when our state had certain counties mandate shutdowns for indoor eating, and switch to carry out only.
This massively screwed over my income. I wasn’t let go due to lack of work, instead I was switched to a low hourly wage and given about 15 hours of work a week. The only thing that saved me for a few months was the stimulus check. 
Long story short, I ended up losing my apartment, and having to move into a roommate situation. 
So flash forward to now, post covid, I ended up leaving that job a few months ago, and started a new job at a local bar.
I’m pretty sure the person I’ve been renting a room from is a drug addict and has really sketchy friends over all of the time. It scares the hell out of me. 
I’ve had my tip money stolen from me multiple times —about 3 times, until I got smart enough to hide my money in my car under my seat. 
I feel scared just being in the house. My roommate is quiet and doesn’t really say anything to me, and I also think they know about my money being stolen from my room.
I’ve been trying desperately to save up to get a room somewhere else, until I can save up for my own apartment again, and then bam, two weeks ago I was let go from my job because I was told I just “didn’t fit in” which made me feel humiliated and confused. I’m guessing it has something to do with the fact that all of the staff like to hang out and party after work, but I go home because I’m exhausted, I don’t really like to drink, and I’m too depressed to socialize anyway. 
I thought I’d be able to get unemployment, but I live in Maryland, which is an “at will” state, and I’m not eligible for unemployment because I haven’t worked at the new bar long enough, and I was not let go due to lack of work.
I’ve been absolutely panicked trying to find a new job, I have applied to over 100 different places for pretty much any job that is hiring, and heard back from only one job, which was a life insurance agent and it turned out I would need at least a grand to put down for my license and leads before I could even start, so that was a dead end.
I feel like my world is collapsing around me.
I reached out to my mother and my sister and my sister just had a baby and said I can’t stay with her because she doesn’t have the room, and my mother is an alcoholic and has a long history of being abusive with me, so I’m really scared to ask her to stay with her again.
I feel completely depressed and like I’m suffocating in sadness and panic.
I am terrified of not being able to afford rent and how my roommate is going to take it, I haven’t eaten in days because I’m saving every penny to try to make my portion of the rent, and no job will call me back.
I feel like I am drowning. I applied for an EBT card for food assistance and they denied me because the only w2 forms I had showed money from when I was working, and they told me to reapply in 4 weeks.
I have started pawning off things I own — my treadmill, my monitors and other pride positions I’ve worked hard to get. 
I have a kitten and I’m so scared I’m going to have to give her up.
I am crying writing this and having a full blown panic attack.

My brother took his own life 4 days after I nearly took mine,"Ever since Christmas I've been lacking all meaning and enjoyment to life. On my 17th birthday I remember coming home early from school to lie on my bed googling my feelings of not wanting to live and then crying as I was met with suicide hotlines and realising I was suicidal. Thinks got progressively worse as I started to feel trapped in my own head unable to escape reality and started thinking of how I might go about killing myself. 

Only 3 weeks ago after starting antidepressants and starting to disassociate finding life a living nightmare, I walked down to the bridge above some train tracks. None of it felt real I felt no emotion towards it I just knew I wanted to die. I became so disconnected to reality I completely forgot about everyone in my life who loves me. I lit a cigarette as I was waiting for the train to come. Before the train came a friend called me and I picked up. They quickly realised something was off, and when the train came it seemed not scary but inviting however, I could let my friend live the trauma of me jumping while on the phone to her. I ended up asking if I could stay round hers until my mum picked me up.
I felt really guilty because I saw everyone upset about my state while I felt complete emptiness and no sadness to the prospect of dying.

Only 4 days later my brother hanged himself. That was the worst news and seeing my mums devastation made me feel even more guilty than I could have left my parents with no sons and my sister with no brothers.
My brother was 36 and he struggled with drugs and alcohol. For ages I had been wanting to reach out to him since he had completely blanked me for about 3 years at this point when I was around. My parents tried to protect me and my sister from him since the drugs had affected him really badly and over many years tried their best to help him.
This really hurts as the last time I saw him was in the carpark but I avoided him like my parents told me. When in actual fact that was one of my last chances to speak to him.

Today I went to see him and it really shocked me into reality since my disassociation from the tablets had me in denial for the last couple of weeks. I am also coming off my medication as they were making me more suicidal.

It really is the worst thing as my family had fallen out with him over supplying drugs to my sister so non of us had closure with him.
I would give anything just to have had one last proper conversation with him.
But now I've lost my big bro who would've looked out for me if I really needed it.
Despite his issues though I was always Really proud of how talented he was many things and really did love him.

I now have no idea what to do with myself even more than before. I still think about killing myself but feel like he took that option away from me. I feel no purpose to live for.

I am being supported by family and professionals but I don't think I will ever be truly happy again or find a reason to live.

How to force myself out of bed in a morning,"17 male, I attend 6th form in the UK and my school are so close to kicking me out as my attendance is getting really bad.

Every morning I can never get out of bed and always end up going back to sleep and missing lessons and I hate myself for it. I’ve got my parents to wake me up but they have to leave about an hour or so before I have to leave for school, I have about 5 alarms after for when they’ve left but I always convince myself 5 more minutes is alright and I always fuck it up. I need a way to genuinely force myself out of bed whether I like it or not because I always resist everything because I’m irrational and stupid as fuck in mornings.

My soul turning its back on the light,"I’ve been realizing lately that my soul has been giving out on me. Like I’m burning out and I can’t find a way to get back up. 

I’m currently 21. Ages 3-16 I’ve been mentally and physically abused throughout life. I’ve faced trauma before and she still haunts me till this day. I think I’ve had high functioning depression for awhile. But these last few weeks have just been so hard waking up in the morning and finding a will to do anything productive with work.

I’m a realtor and I believe my clients can be stressful at times such as when deals fall through and what not so that stress can be there with me along with some debt I’ve dabbled myself in.

I’ve been doing a lot of self improvement stuff lately and reading books and learning more about myself and recently went sober for New Years resolution. Working out 5X a week etc and I still feel like I have no energy even with a clean diet. 

Yet, I still come across this border of depression that haunts me. I feel it’s like once I start slipping I can’t stop sinking deeper and deeper. Usually until I identify what it may be. 

But, I don’t know what it is.

I was thinking of just disappearing for a week and going on a trip by myself or something just to disconnect. I always have this feeling that I need to get out of the house more often and just leave town. Like I kind of want to run away even though I have everything at home.

Any advice? I would appreciate it

I don’t know what to do anymore,"I don’t know what to do, I don’t know what to write here, I don’t know anything. 

I’m not happy with life and haven’t been for a while. 

I used to love watching anime, cooking, and reading. Now anime is just a bunch of lines on my screen, might as well watch paint dry it as entertaining. Everything I cook sucks now, I used to make 4 course meals no problem and now I can’t my Mac and cheese without fucking up! Then reading is impossible because the silence during that time just makes my mind wonder to how sad I feel. 

All joy has been sucked out of my life and I’m left with nothing but porn that gives me 10 seconds of something. Followed by 7 hours of disgust at what I just did. 

I hate living but I don’t want to die. I’m lonely but don’t want to be around people. I want to talk about my problems with someone, but hate the idea of them knowing who I really am. I want to eat but the thought of it makes me sick. I want to sleep but can’t get to it. When I finally fall asleep I do so for 10-14 hours. I want to lose weight but the thought of moving makes me think of my inability to accomplish anything so why bother. I want to go to school but I don’t want to be in debt the rest of my life.

Can I keep on?,"This is turning out to be my worst year in existence, and it’s GOING to get better. It has to?

This morning, I found out that insurance has denied coverage for a hysterectomy, because they found it to be “medically unnecessary.” I first laughed at the fact that I would love for it to be unnecessary, why would I opt for this if I didn’t need it? Then I cried. A whole lot. I’ve already spoken with my doc office, who says they are absolutely going to fight this, and HR who will be too, and as soon as the denial shows up on my account I’m going to file an appeal. I’m in pain every day, including basically making my antidepressants ineffective. My
doc agrees we need to schedule the first available appointment. 

I’m also heading out to Vegas (suburbs) tomorrow, to be with my closest friend in her last days. She’s been sick, and a couple months ago moved with her mom to be with family since her health was declining. She let me know a few days ago that she’s ending treatment. I get it, I’d do the same. Estimation is anywhere from a week to a month.

Adding to this, I was drugged and assaulted mid February while handing out stolen dog signs on behalf of my neighbor. I went into a popular bar in my area asking to put a sign up, and people asked questions so I decided to chill a bit. I’m not drinking unless I’m with friends and with a ride, so I ordered a tonic with lime. Then it got fuzzy and I have a few awful flash memories along with bruises.. I called the bar it happened at to let them know it happened, but I don’t remember his face, so there’s nothing to actually do and they don’t have cameras. Of course I told my partner, he’s amazing and agreed to never bring it up unless I do.

Additionally, before the assault and in an attempt to manage these giant ovarian cysts that won’t quit and sometimes burst, my doc put me on an insulin medication (metformin) in December, because said it helps with cysts in non diabetic people. Instead, it caused a weird kind of psychosis where I nearly killed myself without realizing I was doing it (garage door came down and I kept my car on.) I am of course not on that medication anymore.

Thanks for reading this far, I think that all I’m looking for here is anyone who’s experienced any of this. Before this year, I thought I had experienced too much. This is too much.

How do people just live life? I don't understand it.,"I guess that's the main thing I'm thinking about today. I've been basically isolating myself for the last 6 months. I decided to quit my job because I had become so depressed and suicidal, and the toxic work environment was making me feel worse to the point all I did while I wasn't at work was lie in bed and get drunk and not eat. I was still broke even though I had a job so quitting didn't make much of a difference. But in the last 6 months I've barely left the house at all but for a trip to the grocery store once every couple weeks and sometimes out to hang out with people I don't even want to hang out with. I don't know if I feel better or worse than I did before. Mostly I just don't feel anything except for when the overwhelming sadness and hopelessness starts to creep back in, but even then, it's like nothing I feel or think makes any sense. 

I'm trying to distract myself with doing things I like and hobbies I never had time for while working but sometimes it's hard to make myself stop laying in bed or just sitting there staring at the wall. It's like every day I feel less and less motivated and less like anything even matters. I have time for hobbies, but to what end? I have all the time in the world but it just seems so meaningless. I don't hang out with people because trying to pretend I'm having fun and like I care about anything gets so exhausting. At a certain point it's just more trouble than it's worth. Aside from that, I barely have the energy to shower or brush my hair. And really, I can't stand being around people because they're all so happy. Like, even when they're not happy they're happy, you know what I mean? And functional. And productive, like they really see a point in doing the things they're doing and working towards achieving. Or like they actually have hope and faith in themselves to achieve something. And I can't be any of that even when I try. I'm done trying to work a job because everywhere I go people just treat me like I'm stupid and like it would be better if I just wasn't there at all. I wanted to try working from home to not have to be around people and be bullied anymore while still making a paycheck but I'm too stupid and now I can barely pull myself out of the brain fog I've just been sitting here alone with for the last 6 months. 

I can't afford therapy and even if I could I'm too afraid to get on antidepressants because I'm not sure if it's a chemical thing or if I'm not happy just because my life sucks. I'd rather just change how bad my life sucks than take pills that make me think it doesn't, but then again that's not an option either. I've been this way my whole life, and I don't want to say I'm just not meant to be happy, but it's more like I've lost the ability, or maybe never had it in the first place. I don't even need to be happy all the time, I would just like to not have to be depressed and feel so hopeless and indifferent to everything. I wish I knew what it felt like to care and see a point. Even when I try to fake like I do, it's like I can't convince myself completely. There's always this voice in my head going ""what are you even doing? You know you're not normal like everyone else"". It's like imposter syndrome, but with just being a normal person who cares about being alive and is enthusiastic about doing things. It sounds so stupid, but I really just don't know how to be that person anymore.",ReallyRealPotato,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttfcrc/how_do_people_just_live_life_i_dont_understand_it/

I have tried the asking out a few people to make my days feel better and rest assured hasn’t landed well. My oldest friend who was a girl blocked me after the agonizing rejection and back in home I deal with parents who really don’t as much they have before. I still don’t know shit about driving and I’m 18 like I’m said which takes me too much to think about. There are people I love for and care for but it’s rare to see myself in their shoes and honestly fighting off my sadness is the thing I’ve tried doing a lot recently. Now I have to wait my time out.

I feel like I’m in a downward spiral but everyone tells me I should be grateful for my life.,"
I’m 23 years old, graduated college last year and live away from my family, recently moved to a new city and have a new job that pays well. While my professional life has been okay, my personal life seems to be falling apart. My family lives in a different country- I moved away at 18 for college because the thought of staying with them any further made me want to die. My childhood wasn’t great and I really don’t know how to let go of those demons. Currently, I’m on speaking terms with my parents and I’m paying them back for college but I haven’t seen them in 3 years.

Outside of family, all my friends here were people I met in college. We all moved to different places after graduating and even though we talked about how we’ll fly to see each other, the reality is that it’s really hard to do that when you have a regular, 9-5 job with limited time off. I’m also introverted and it seems to be getting worse so it’s already hard to make friends but I don’t even know where to begin. My coworkers are all at least 20 years older than me, I live in a smaller town and don’t know anyone here, and I don’t know how to meet new people.

I’m finding myself using weed everyday to cope with the loneliness. I don’t know if this would be considered as addiction, but I hate sober thoughts. I’m embarrassed to admit but when I run out of weed/alcohol, I take benadryl so I can sleep through the day so I don’t have to think. I also sleep 8+ hours every night and still feel sleepy in the morning. Sleep feels like an escape as well.

This month has been especially hard. I started my new job with a lot of expectations. While the money is good, I work in a male-dominated industry and interact with men who hit on me, even though I’m clearly so much younger than them. There’s also casual sexism- being told to smile (am I supposed to concentrate on work or just sit there and smile?), older female coworkers making indirect remarks on my clothes/appearance, etc.. I can’t leave my job (visa-related reasons and I have no savings), can’t deal with moving again, and definitely can’t (and won’t) go back to my parents.

I have spent so much money on therapy in the last few years but cannot seem to find the right person. I also find myself lying to therapists because I can’t bring myself to talk about deep emotions with strangers and I’m also scared that I will be sent to a psychiatric unit.

I feel so frustrated because I did everything right and worked so hard to get out of where I was. I would dream of being independent and living life on my own terms but everything seems off now when I’m living that life. My parents had an awful, abusive relationship and the trauma is so deep that I cannot bring myself to date anyone. The few past relationships that I did have also resulted in me being cheated on, used, lied to and I think I will be alone for the rest of my life. I feel like I have no home and no person to go to. I don’t think I’m suicidal anymore- I just think I’m a very damaged person and probably will never feel normal. All my friends from back home tell me I’m living the life they would dream of- that I’m independent, living abroad, seemingly enjoying my 20s- but clearly that’s so far from the truth. Not sure what else to say. I’m generally an optimistic person but lately it’s been so hard and I’m finding myself in a downward spiral.",girlfriend_inacoma,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttf8f0/i_feel_like_im_in_a_downward_spiral_but_everyone/

trying to explain everything happening to me rn the best I can,"SO this is gonna be a lot so I deeply apologize for it. I'll a start off with my feelings and shitty mood changes. My mood changes suck. Any little thing can fuck up my whole mood even if a really tiny thing. I could be in a okay mood and boom on little thing and my whole mood is fucked. I haven't been really really happy in such a long time. I've been ""kinda happy"" if that. My mood can change in one snap of a finger. I feel like my feelings are slowly leaving me to the point I won't have any feelings anymore. I almost always feel sad or angry or annoyed barely ever if ever happy. I feel sad but can never cry. I have daily panic attacks some variting from not to bad to really really bad. Everything stresses me tiny things to big things to things that shouldn't even matter at all. I have my bf for support which he helps me a lot and I appreciate him so much. I try not to put to much onto him because he has his own problems and I don't wanna add to that. I can't focus at school cause I have so fucking much going on in my fucking head that it fucks with me and I can't get a single fucking thing done. I can barely process much and I forget things super easily. My anger is bad I can get mad at the tiniest little things. Basically my feelings are very easily triggered it doesn't take much to make them happen. I'm soft to the point I can barely handle a joke. Even if a joke it hurts me. Everything hurts me everything makes me upset even sometimes everything makes me mad or annoyed but I don't wanna tell anyone it does cause I don't wanna show how weak I am. I want to stop being so soft I'm too easy to break. It doesn't take much to break me I'm easily broken but I also feel like it barely effects me anymore even through it does. Everything is so confusing idk what to do anymore it's all so much everything is too much I can't do it even though I know I can my feelings are taking so much in at once they are broken. I can feel so many things at once. It hurts. Constantly I wake up wanting to hurt myself. Going to school is hard for me. Waking up is hard. Going to sleep is hard. Simple work is hard. Exercise is hard. Trying not to show my full emotions at school is hard cause if I do ik for a fact the school is gonna do some shit and get me sent back to fucking therapy which doesn't work for shit for me it makes me uncomfortable and makes everything worse and I feel like nothing helps barely. I feel broken and I feel empty. I'm tired of having to do this everyday but I know I can't kill myself no matter how hard I try I've tired and I've stopped cause I can't do it but I want to. I don't even know anymore I've lost almost everything important to me. My grandma is gone. I put a shit ton of pressure on my mom as she's the only one taking care of me. My grandpa barely helps at all and spends all his money on gambling. I don't wanna put all this pressure on my mom and I try not to but it's all too much for me to handle and process and I'm lost. My mind is pull way past its fucking breaking point but I keep it all in. I don't want to release it because I feel like it will put pressure on everyone I know and I don't wanna do that. I don't know anymore im lost and I feel broken.

I'm walking into a wall,"In my life, I find that I am walking into a wall. I can only remember the sights of the past, I can only see the gloomy, dirty present and I cannot see a pleasant future. Over the past 2 terms in my first year of uni, I have questioned why I am alive more than I did in high school as I really don't see why I need to or should be. I don't get good grades, I spend money on food and games that I am not good at, I cant make conversation with people due to me being very shy, and I also have problems with my weight and height. I feel as if my folks are wasting money on me as all I'm really doing is wasting it. I try to study but I don't get any of it and I am too ashamed to ask for help.

It looks so silly writing it out. I graduated high school during covid and after seeing the moves that my classmates made then and what they are doing now I am realizing that they always had their shit together even the ones that some looked down upon. I'm not jealous in fact I'm happy for them but it sucks to get one uped but they aren't the only ones, people are the world are making their dreams come true surpassing their limits despite adversity, and even though some fail at least they tried. However, I am different I am the spitting image of insecurity I am fat and short, and I stop trying after my head hurts a little while others bust their ass every day to get what they want. I'm sure that there are people with even worse problems than mine who are trying their best every day but yet here I am walking into this grey wall or my own despair to be afraid to push it down or go around perfectly comfortable wallowing in agony.

If only I could stop time,"I often think about a line sung by Sam Cooke, “it’s been too hard living, but I’m afraid die cause I don’t what’s up there beyond the sky.” It rings the truest bell for me. Color me narcissistic, but I wish to never be without my consciousness. The possibility of the end of existence is too deep and dark of a pit to stare into and be able to jump. I feel alone in almost every aspect of my life, though I have friends and family who’d shed their blood to see me unharmed. I don’t totally understand the causation behind my disillusionment, but I feel it resides, in part, in that belief of being forever alone. The kicker, I think I’d be happiest if that were truly the case. I feel too guilty envisioning apocalyptic parameters that would grant me such a “paradise” as the lone survivor. So, I think about if I could stop time. With such a power, I could live without meaning, and in that meaningless existence, the sun wouldn’t set, tomorrows inevitably sour reality wouldn’t dawn, and nothing would exist. What can exist in the space between moments? Is there any point towards getting better? I feel myself to be the foundations of my bad mistakes, and since then, the unbreakable Mortar and brick of every subsequent worse one. In a time between seconds, history doesn’t matter. The future holds uncertainty and with that endless possibility, but when I gaze ahead I see a fixed corridor. Be it true or not, my belief as such cements it to be so. How could I change this? My beliefs don’t exist when the hands of the clock stop. As for the past, what my mind allows me to remember becomes whole-fully less appealing with adage of even “pleasant” memories. The childhood I’m able to relish in fades with the sound each step, but there aren’t any sounds if time isn’t there to allow them to spill out. Please, how could I pause all time on earth?

And never went back, her mom is a big time alcoholic, who can’t look after her, can’t help her at all, and me, I had a pretty good childhood blue collar parents, toy, finished middle and high school and have worked most of my life, I gave her everything, I did everything for her, she was all my motivation to move forward, from her glasses, switch, iPhones, feeding her, giving her a loving roof over her head with a “real family” but it wasn’t good enough, she broke up with me 3 days ago… after talking about being with me forever, her grandfather used to look after her but he passed just before we met, and she told me she thinks her grandfather sent me to take care of her when he passed… anyways I did everything I used to work away, I quit and came home to less money to take care of her and I’m fine with it, but as I was saying she broke up with me 3 days ago… saying “it’s for us” “I’ve grown into someone I don’t wanna be” “I’m not happy” but she also tells me she loves me more then anything… for 3 days I haven’t been able to get outta my bed, all I do is cry and fight for my life in my own head over this.. I feel like I failed… I was a little hard on her due to her behaviour… like screaming at me to shower when I do everyday… or screaming at me cuz she was hungry… but I always solved the problems… I just asked her to respect me… and I felt like she didn’t… but now she’s gone and I’m really not sure what to do anymore… I’ve called sick into work for the past 3 days now and I’m scared I’m going to lose my only job and lose everything… my parents “aka the only ppl I have left to talk too” don’t even care and just tell me I’m going to ruin my life and get fired.. and that makes me wanna hurt my self more… but I need this chick.. let’s call her L she is irreplaceable, we still talk… but it’s tearing me apart…",articwolf223,11,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttbrp6/i_really_need_some_advice/

How do I get myself to feel again?,"It's been a long time since I've felt this way. I used to cry every single night, waiting for the day that some unfortunate accident would happen to me. Now I hold a strong belief that life is beautiful, and humanity is precious, and love is why we are all here. 

Why doesn't this apply to me?

I started to drink. My depression took over and I hadn't gone a day without either drinking or smoking weed in months. Only 2 weeks ago was I able to accept that I'm a severe alcoholic, and that I'm never going to be able to drink again. Only yesterday was I able to get myself to start a tolerance break. Life is everything. It's beautiful and there's nothing in the universe that can match it. It breaks my heart that I'm destroying myself-- I'm supposed to love myself. Why don't I love myself?

I thought quitting drinking would open my eyes but I'm more depressed than ever. I can't go a minute alone but I can't stand being around others. I need to isolate but I need someone to hold me and tell me it's going to be okay. Nothing distracts me because everything is suddenly boring. I dropped out of school and I'm unemployed so there's nothing for me to look forward to. 

It's ironic how much it hurts to not be able to feel anything.",ro_413,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttdszi/how_do_i_get_myself_to_feel_again/
Have you ever had a job that sucked the joy out of your life,"So I feel like I need to talk about what happened to me. And I need some help getting over it

&amp;#x200B;

I used to work at Five Guys for two and a half years. For one year I was a Shift Lead in training. The second I was a Shift Lead. I was 19 years old when I first started the job.

I think Five Guys is the reason I don't feel any strong emotions. I don't feel excitement. I don't feel anger. I don't feel happy or sad. I just feel like I am going through the emotions, despite how good my life is becoming.

I knew there were a few older workers interested in me. I did not think much of it at the time. I was young, and when you're young you don't believe in bad people. I knew maybe they wanted something from me. I did not know is they used to talk about my body all the time. About the shape of my body. About my butt and my waist. That they would go around telling everyone what they were going to ""hit it."" The general manager at the time used to call me and text me around 12 in the morning. I know you're reading this wondering why I did not quit. I should have, but I really wanted the shift lead position. I wanted to put it on my resume so bad. 

Eventually I transferred stores for a while, hated the GM and came back. There was a new General Manager, and the previous one got demoted to assistant manager. I did not think much about the general manager, but as time went on I became really uncomfortable with his presence. It started with him joking around that his wife was jealous of me. He would comment on it a lot. Eventually he grew comfortable. It became increasingly obvious what he favored me. A lot. He touched my shoulders, my waist, sometimes my thighs more frequently. I was maybe 20 now. He made it seem like it was always an accident. He apologized immediately as soon as he did it. Later, he began commenting how beautiful I was. One time, how thick my thighs were. How I had a 'nice' walk. 

People obviously began noticing. Especially the unsolicited favoritism that came with it. People began commenting, but I turned my head to the side. I was better than getting upset over some pathetic teasing. I was not aware of the ugly jealousy one of the older female shift leads had over the favoritism. A few months before I was aware this occurred, but she started spreading suggestions that  The General Manager favored me because I provided him favors. That I would give him head when no one was around so I could get a raise. I would not have been upset about it if someone did not ask me if this was true. I was pretty close to the coworker that asked me. It obviously hurt, like what. I got irritated and I started ranting about it to someone, just to realized they thought it too. It did not take long before I realized everyone knew about this rumor, or thought it. It hurt so bad. At this point I already had to deal with a handful of older men trying to makes moves, or starring, or belittling me in some way. But the fact that this one bitch spread this rumor, and everyone knew it but I didnt; it really put me in a low place. It did not help that I basically sexually assaulted from someone outside of work. It just kicked me when I was already down.

The job was not easy either. I just felt so drained. On one end I had to deal with all these unsolicited touches, and gossips, and stares. Apparently there was a bet on who could fuck me first when I was still 19. Did not realize this until I was 21. I was just so tired. On the other end, the job sucked so much. People were constantly calling off. The workers were trying to fight each other. All of my favorite people quit cause of school. It got so bad that sometimes I would break down crying as I was driving to my job. 

At this point I wanted to quit. I would spend my whole entire day at this fucking job. 3-11, almost every single day. 3-11 I would think about how much I hated it there. I would get flashes of anger over stuff the older female shift lead said or complained about me. It made me mad the general manager never did anything. I got accepted to College in New York (I lived in California), so i decided to stick it out a little longer. What was the point of quitting and finding a new job when I was leaving in 14 weeks? I hated the job so much. Eventually all those days began blurring out for me. The days were so long that I started drinking and smoking on the shift. I was always a good kid; this was uncommon behavior for me. I hated the job. I HATED Five Guys. I hated that I felt so belittled. I hated my body and its curves. I hated that I could not do anything about it. I hated everything about the job was unfair. I just became so drained. And I had other stuff going on. I dont care what anyone says, your job is a BIG factor of your life. I spent my WHOLE entire day there, for almost 2 and a half years. It was two and a half years of being broken down and constantly feeling humiliated because of the way men viewed me.

If you have ever been in this situation, how did you heal?

I'm 22 now. I live in New York. I go to school here. I don't know why I can't seem to be happy. It just feeling like I am going through the motions, like I'm not even here. I got accepted to this internship I REALLY wanted, and I did not even feel happy about it. I was content, but I didn't have the energy to feel happy.

Feeling a Quarter Life Crisis,Long story short when I was 18 last fall I dropped out of college last second which caused my parents to get pissed and kick me out of their house. I moved in with my grandparents and around this time my girl broke up with me. I managed to get myself my own place but everyone I really cared about was gone. Over time I got back along with my parents and the thought of the chance the girl and I would get back together would get me out of bed every morning. I hit up the girl that broke up with me and she said she has a new boyfriend now. A little bit later I lost my job due to not getting there on time (would stay in bed awake). Now I don’t have a job to distract me or girl to motivate me and alone with my thoughts. It really hit me how little time we have to live and it really brings me down. I’m 19 living with the responsibilities of a full grown adult and I can’t wrap around my head how much time has passed. Not even 20 yet but I’ve all of a sudden developed this terrible fear of our inevitable death.

Fears,"Is anyone here afraid of things needed in order to function in society?   


Going out (especially by myself) scares me so much because it seems like everyone is getting worse and more unhinged. You could be minding your business and somebody decides that you are the one they want to bother. I can defend myself, but I’m afraid that if I defend myself, I may go to jail. I’ve seen too many times where people defend themselves out of fear and end up going to prison, and the attacker gets off.   
It bothers me more that I am a woman. With all the kidnappings and sex trafficking, I’m just so scared and would rather stay in my room. I don’t even feel completely safe in my room, that’s just my safest place and has been ever since I was little. 

Learning how to drive scares me, too. I’m afraid that I that might panic if something happens and do the wrong thing and hurt someone. I know I’ll never forgive myself for it. I was in an accident at 11 years old (the car flipped), and I’ve been scared ever since. It really didn’t help that everyone I know drives like maniacs (following too close, driving too fast, not paying attention to the road, road rage, driving impaired). It like everyone thinks they’re in a video game. 

I don’t think I would be so afraid if I had people around me who loved and protected me, but I’ve never had that. I’ve always had to protect and soothe myself the best way I knew how from the people who were supposed to do that. Now I don’t trust anyone, so it’s hard to form close relationships.",AChairInTheCloset,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttb1fz/fears/
Too narcissistic to cut so I did this instead:,"I’m 19 now and when I was about 12/13, I entered a depression that would last through the rest of my grade school career. In 8th grade, I considered physical self harm but I was too narcissistic to be “that kid” with visible cuts on her arm. I tried pinching and poking but it wasn’t enough to overwhelm the feeling of emptiness. One day, I came across shock websites and the first image I saw was the aftermath of a sniper shooting down a suicide bomber somewhere in the Middle East. It disgusts me and makes me tear up to say this, but my brain lit up for the first time in awhile. After that, I visited my favorite shock websites everyday after school. I didn’t even realize it at the time, but this was my form of self harm. I eventually kicked the habit a few years ago but realized how desensitized I’d become when just a few days ago, I found a video of a lathe accident here on Reddit. I showed my boyfriend cuz I thought that shit was crazy but I failed to realize the difference between my brain and his. I felt so judged by him, he got this disgusted ass look on his face and asked me, “How do you watch that shit?” He knows about my old habit and I explained that I just don’t feel anything anymore. After that, he got quiet and was clearly disturbed. I felt like a monster. I feel as though my alternative form of self harm left me with scars deeper than any blade could have. I came here hoping someone could relate to this because I don’t know who else I can talk to about this. I just want a judgement free conversation if anyone can offer me that.

I'm a failure," I am a high school student. People tell me I'm smart or something like that, but my grades are low and I no longer have the motivation to participate in my school activities. I'm lazy, a picky eater, I get annoyed easily, bad at sports, a pushover because I don't see any purpose in standing up for myself because I feel like I don't have enough worth to do so. I like playing games since I grew up on the internet. My parents are separated, I spend most of my time with my mother. My mother is a nurse, she is busy and she cannot take care of me because of that reason. I live with my grandmother who takes care of me. She visits on weekends and we go travel, though we never talked much or were close. I used to be an honor student and now I do not even get a line of 9 in most of my grades. I don't understand why this is happening to me, I have the potential. I'd like to try to get myself diagnosed with any mental illness but I am absolutely terrified of doing so because once I wrote a poem about depression to fit in with my friends, which led to my teachers thinking I have it. My mom had a talk with me about depression and I absolutely hated having to look her in the eye and talk about it, more than anything. My friends are smart and I feel like they see me as a complete idiot and it scares me so much. I feel like I am in my own world most of the time, where only I understand myself and nobody else does. I sometimes get irritated and I talk back rudely to my grandmother and when I look back on that, it breaks my heart because she has been here for me since I was 6 and I love her more than anything. She is the kindest person I've met and I would kill for her. For all these reasons, I'd like to kill myself to run away from my responsibilities but I'm scared of how it would affect the people I love and how it would feel.

I'm afraid of death but I want to kill myself.,"I never thought depression hurts this much. It felt like choking me to death. My chest hurts. My mind is all over the place. I feel numb.

All these years, I'm trying to reach my parent's expectations. But they just keep on looking at my mistakes and comparing me to my siblings and other people. I'm 23 female. My depression started during college. Though I passed all my courses in one take, my parents were never proud of it because it wasn't high enough. Almost all satisfactory. They would always tell and make me feel how worthless and disappointed they were in me. Even now.

My mother would blame me for their mistakes and my siblings'. She said that I'm so dramatic when I told them I am depressed. She yells at me even for the smallest mistake. I am currently living with them and my depression keeps getting worse.

This year, I am frequently going to multiple doctors because my case is rare. It could cost me death if I will not get treatment as early as possible. Last February, I was confined due to severe body pain and I was forced to stop working and I don't have a lot of savings.  Until now, we were going to the hospital and my parents are paying a hefty amount of money for my laboratory tests. I felt so bad because I'm a nuisance to them. My mother kept on telling me how my father's salary is not enough every month. I get anxious when I ask her for money so I could buy medicine. She gets so angry about how pricey my medicines are.

I just sit and cry," 

I wake up in the morning and cry. I cry at my desk while I work. I cry quietly at night before I go to bed.

I used to travel. I used to spend lots of time in the outdoors. I have a wife and a few month old child. My wife insists on living in one of the most expensive counties in the United States. We can't afford to move. I pay all the bills on a single income while she stays home. I'm too exhausted to exercise and I don't care anymore. My wife says my hobby is too much of a priority to me so I don't do it anymore.

I look at new jobs to make more money to support them. I still won't be able to save enough to do anything different. I can't afford the child support if I divorce and still live near my child.

I had hopes and dreams while I was still young enough and healthy to do them. But all I'm going to do is work for my wife and kid. And cry. Again. Right now in fact.

I can't invest enough. I can't save enough. I drive a 14 year old car with multiple issues. It looks like shit. I can't afford a new one.

I have a wife, a kid, and dogs. Everyone else needs to be taken care of before I am. I want to delete my Facebook account and forget about things I did. Burn the memories. Take down the pictures of places I went before all this started.

I hate my fucking life. I can't fucking change any of it. I'm trapped in an endless groundhog day of hell.

And I cry again. I'm on antidepressants. My blood pressure and cholesterol are high. I've been gaining weight.

I'm really tired of life but i actually have a good life,"(My English is bad so i apologize for any spelling mistakes)

I am a 21 y/o male. The reason i say this is because i'm tired of evrything just going wrong. I'm tired of trying to fix evryone's problems. 

About 4 years ago i got into a motorcycle accident and i didn't wear a helmet. My mom didn't believe that it wasnt my fault.  2 years later i crashed my dad's truck. That was my fault and i admitted it. This year i crashed my mom's truck and it wasnt my fault. Multiple witnesses yet she doesn't believe me. The truck is getting fixed by the insurance but now we have to rent a car and the insurance isn't paying.. i told my mom i'm sorry for what i did but she keeps guilt tripping me about it saying that she never should've let me drive that day and that i always do this.. the same happened with my dad's truck where he kept telling me i have to buy him a new one . But u have scars on my face from the crash and to this day i have nightmares about it

I m tired of people trying to ''help'' me. Evryone keeps giving me the same advice.Tonight i thought about doing something really stupid just so that people can stop worrying about me. I'm just tired of not being okay and not being able to express it. I know there are people out there with so much worse problems but i just cant cope anymore.  Evry single night i go to sleep at 3 am and wake up at 7 am just so that i cant dream. I'm always low energy and just not wanting to go through with my day. I dont have real friends i can hang out with just people on the internet and its really starting to make me feel super lonely.  I just want some human interaction.  A hug. A hand shake. A slap. Fucking anything!

My sexual desires led me to depression.,"
I’ve been suicidal for almost a year now and have had depression for 3 years. I’ve had a very strong porn addiction for a long time it started out incident you know just a regular kid starting to experience sexual activities per say for the first time. As time went on the things i once enjoyed a lot weren’t as enjoyable anymore so I started trying out different typa porn. I got into more fetish like stuff like feet, handcuffs etc. as time went on I started getting into some bizzare shit and my addiction to porn was on a whole other level to the point where I needed to Jack off 3 times everyday. My addiction took a dark turn for the worst and has left me suicidal.

Here is a List of the dark things I did sexually that I will never forgive myself for:
- I sniffed my dads underwear and jacked off with them. 
- I took my parents dildos sucked them and put them up my ass.
- I’ve put on my moms cloths and underwear, socks and even sniffed her shoes.
- I’ve jerked off to animal porn horses, dogs etc
- I tried to make a dog lick my dick and asshole (thank god she didn’t)
- I took my brothers girlfriends Sandles and sniffed them and jacked off with them. 
- child porn……
- even myself…..

I am in fear that one day I will wake up and won't have the power to endure things anymore,"About 2 months after covid had begun I was diagnosed with depression by a psychiatrist who kept on treating me until he made me go into a clinic specialized on my problems, which was a very good choice and might have saved my life. The problem was that due to an unfortunate event the connection to the psychiatrist ended and left me all on my own when my time in the clinic was up. I wasn't cured or anything, even the doctors at the clinic said my depression was only contained for now. From that time on I had to search for a new therapy to continue the process of healing. I was very close to giving up because in my country even tho you wouldn't think so it's made extremely hard to find therapy. If it wasn't to my wonderful girlfriend who kept helping and supporting me I would have been dead before I got the first therapist, then again right before going into the clinic and now once more. After another couple of months she found me a therapy which I gladly visited but after five sessions the therapist made clear that I had to find another one again.

&amp;#x200B;

That was in january. Again since then we have been searching for a new therapy but weren't able to.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now I am not suicidal and my depression still kinda feels contained, but with every day my life keeps getting worse and bit for bit all those bad feelings keep coming back more and more. But the biggest problem is that I don't seem to be able to do anything about it. Every day I fight against it and although I often fail I keep trying. But day after day I am getting reminded that this condition was already for a long time out of my own hand and the more I keep crying out without an answer the feeling of senselessness is coming back.

"Hand on heart, I tried my best. So WTF do I do now?","Others have it worse of course, but holy shit, I have no idea where to go now.

What else is there after trying my best. I've had to put up with a lot along the way, but i still kept at it, in an attempt to make it all worth it. Growing up with a bipolar mum &amp; cheating dad, it would have been easy to add to the noise like my sister did. I don't blame her of course it was a pretty difficult upbringing. But I just kept quiet and tried to make the situation better for everyone.

Then comes the 6yr abusive rl that started at uni. I was happy &amp; hopeful for maybe the first time in my life after the first yr of uni. Got a gf during second year, she was previously in an abusive rl, but i wanted to help and show her that life is worth it. Problem is she continued the cycle of abuse and abused me in return. Made me feel guilty for having friends, sexually abused me, isolated me from everyone, and borderline threatened to kill or cut herself. She justified it all by pointing to the abuse, kinda hard to find a comeback to that. A 20yr friend even made it worse by telling his gf who then told my abuser i suspected she was abusing me. Which made me doubt myself and I started thinking I was the abuser somehow. How i got a degree through that i will never know. Because that motivated person is long gone and isn't coming back. My dad also ended up in hospital after i told him i wanted to quit my masters, with a heart scare, after we argued on the phone. That was the moment where i realised i am not allowed to life live like others without being a monster. 

It's been 2yrs since i left the abusive rl, 2yrs of therapy &amp; meds and i still feel nothing. extra bonus points for covid happening 2 months after i leave as well btw. I've lost all parts of myself that made me alright, my fun side has been sanded down to nothing after yrs of isolation. I have zero motivation as i drift from one shit temp job to another. I just don't care, nothing really matters to me in comparison to what i've been through. The idea that x or y matters in the face of me being abused for example, doesn't register to me at all.

I tried, I really did but there is nothing here for me now. I've reached my own personal limit where the best things in the world could happen to me, and honestly i'd still feel the same.

There's more, but this is already long enough.",anonymous876543,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttbqpn/hand_on_heart_i_tried_my_best_so_wtf_do_i_do_now/

Am I dead?,"I really wasn't sure where to put this, but let me start out with one thing: I know I am not dead, but at the same time, I feel like I died a long time ago due to the symptoms of my current Depression.

If I was dead rn, here would be my death story based on my conclusions:

***

It was a cool day in 2020 during the quarantine, I was coding, and I was simply getting up after my head hurt from coding. 

However, I eventually began to feel dizzy, which was pretty normal at the time btw. I had been dealing with on and off dizziness before.

But what wasn't normal during this time, is that I fainted hard on the floor.

This is how I died, by my head hitting the floor too hard. 

***

Okay, so I'm questioning whether I'm dead or not because nothing feels the same anymore. I remember not feeling the same about music anymore a month after the incident (I never went to the doctor for it, mind you.) I just feel dead due to all of my symptoms. Plus, crazy things have been happening too, I  became an extremely religious Christian completely on my own without my family's influence, and then, after that, I turned into a calm bisexual.

However, I was then struck with a stubborn case of Depression with a little bit of derealization/depersonalization (I don't remember which one but I constantly felt like I was sharing my body with someone else and sometimes my skin didn't feel like mine. 

Then, Depression struck, and during my first ""attack"" you could say, I felt someone trying to choke me (no one was there) I panicked so much that my body was really stiff the next morning.

I then felt a ton of suicidal thoughts due to my Depression, and now we're here.

Point is, I feel like I died and that I'm here rn because I didn't get to live my full life. Don't ask me why, because I know I'm not dead, but I feel really dead? I don't know why. I just know I feel like a little kid trapped in an adult's body so often nowadays.

I also see this weird sequence of numbers all the time on my phone (I have no idea where they came from) I just know that they're: 689 63 16

I can't help but to feel that they're the code to get me out of here, but I don't want the code because it feels creepy.

"depression, please read (trigger warning)","I need some where safe to vent. So here it goes, I was born with cleft palate and because of that I have speaking problems, I was bullied through out school and I started to self harm ""cutting, burning and overdosing"" I've been neglected by my narcissistic parents. I watched my mother die when I was 16 then watched my father bring a druggie who was shooting up with kids in the house. I ended up breaking my leg earlier that year and my dad was semi concerned but the lady was emotionally abusive. I met a guy and got married only for him to be a narcissistic abusive cheater and compulsive liar... So it's 2018 now and I had just gotten out of the mental hospital only to find out he was sleeping with his ex. He manipulated me into going to a party and I remember bits and pieces but he shot me up with meth and heroin... I woke up and a bunch of men had used me... I've felt disgusting afterwards and I hated my body even more...  Around November me and him got into a argument about our financial situation. I went outside to smoke a cigarette and calm down so we could talk like rational adults, I walked back inside only to find him hanging from the closet door.. he had already pissed himself. I was looking for scissors to cut him down then called the ambulance... His grandfather and grandmother were harassing me online and in person.. threatening me saying they were going to have me arrested for attempted murder. For one I am 5'2 and have stubby t-rex arms, he is 6'3 and muscular... How tf could I do that without him fighting back? In February of 2019 I found out I was pregnant and I was happy. He was not... A month later it was around my birthday I was getting off work and he picked me up with 3 other people, I recognized two of them. I didn't know the other girl though, she was 16, he was 23 and I was 22 at this time... I felt left out because I was pregnant and they were partying without me... I waited for my ex to come check on me but nothing, 20 mins went by and I went to our room, two friends we're playing COD. My ex and the other girl couldn't be found but the bathroom door is locked...  I knocked on the door, I heard faint moans and I grabbed a steak knife from the kitchen and tried prying open the door... It didn't work and I ended up cutting my hand without realizing it.  He finally cracked the door open and asked me what I wanted.. I used my body weight and pushed it open only to find him with a boner, naked on the toilet and her partially nude in our shower.. I asked what was going on and the girl looked at me and said ""yeah I fucked your husband"" I got pissed, grabbed her hair and pushed her face first into the corner then as my ex tried to grab me I stabbed him in the thigh. A week later we were in Tennessee to visit the aquarium for my birthday and the entire 2 hour's there,we're listening to 'dont worry be happy' while he proceeds to tell his pregnant wife (me)  that if we didn't work out he was gonna get with her.... On march 17. That night he abused me. Headbutting, kicking my stomach, punching me, choking me, hitting me in the stomach with a chair.  I finally ran away and got ahold of my sister who picked me up... I ended up losing my baby and had to have surgery to remove it... I sadly can't get pregnant after that..... I found out that after I left he hooked up with a random chick and got her knocked up...

Am i doing the right Thing?,"Hey Guys i (22M) ve been in a relationship for now over a year and month and for me she (19F) is definetely my favorite person and the person i ve ever loved the most. Our relationship builds on trust, respect and understanding and we try to simply be there for each other. But she is clinicaly depressed and has a hard time controlling her emotions lashing out to others when she is put under external pressure like work, school or simply tasks of life. In her life she has very often been alone with her problems and in times of great pressure when she crumbles under her problems she reacts in a manic sort of way and lashes out resulting in her hurting herself or others and  being alone since the people around her can not deal with her attacks and do not want to risk getting hurt while trying to get close to her when she is in that state of mind. During those manic phases which she has during mental breakdowns she simply does not want to live anymore and wants to hurt herself by any means. She has given up and wants to leave to deal with her problems by being alone and cutting herself. I have always tried to be there for her and help her regardless of the situation and sometimes put myself through great pain physically and mentally by being hit or insulted or put through stressful situations. Aside from me she doesnt really have anyone and to me she is the love of my life and has helped me overcome problems of my own and becoming a more loving and simply better yersion of myself. In my life I have learned to put myself behind and sadly developed the fear of being left alone once i do not benefit the people around me or my problems become to much to handle so i never try to be dead weight for others and i can not make myself abandon her even if I go through pain because I wish to never be left alone in my darkest moments. I am afraid that I am doing the wrong thing since she always regrets hurting me and wishes for me to leave the relationship because of the pain and suffering she puts me through because of her illness. I do not want to give up on her or the relationship because in my eyes she is the most kind, compassionate and understanding person in my life and I do not want to lose her. In my eyes she is the perfect partner but is simply a victim of her mental illness but I dont know If it will ever become better in spite of her efforts and If No If I should leave the relationship and when can i even decide if the point reached where I know she can no longer be helped. I dont want to abandon and desert her when she is in need of help but at the same time i dont want to suffer.

Today Feels… Heavy,"I’m having one of those days where existence just feels crazy. I feel like I can feel the earth and the galaxy around me. I can feel the billions of people that are, at this exact moment, breathing the same oxygen as me, in the same atmosphere as me, who are in the same exact place as me but are also separate from me. In my mind I see lightning bolts transforming into rivers transforming into roads transforming into tree branches transforming into the veins in my own arms. I’m thinking about how while you’re reading this it’s almost like you’re reading my mind, or maybe I’m  infiltrating yours. Who knows. 

To be who we are in this moment is insane. What are the odds that in a “reality” so vast and so limitless, you and I are who and what we are? One minor shift and we could have been any other organism. The prerequisites that allow our very existence are so delicate and monumental and I don’t think twice about it usually. There’s a reason and a purpose far beyond our understanding for why we experience certain things. And when I think about that, the things that are weighing heavily on my mind begin to relinquish their grip on me. 

The older I get the more I feel that people like us who struggle so badly are just the product of evolution in a materialistic and individualistic society (depending on what country you’re in). It’s okay to not feel like you fit because it’s kind of a blessing when you think about it. Why would I want to be a carbon copy of Steve in accounting or Debra in HR? Who actually wants that? -

 (If you do want that, or are that, it’s totally valid and I mean no disrespect. Im only addressing people with whom this resonates) 

- I personally have tried to be that and I’ve never felt more empty, unfulfilled, and anonymous. There are days when I envy people who can participate in this version of life without suffering the ramifications that sometimes accompany it. But then there are days like today where I feel so special to just be drawing breathe. It’s a balance really. I know that without the negative experiences I would not recognize a positive experience even if it abruptly interjected itself into my life. 

So today, I’m deciding to practice gratitude consistently. I believe it may be the key to my salvation which is quite ironic to me. Gratitude is sometimes the LAST thing I want to practice because whether or not I admit it, I’ve become quite comfortable in my suffering. If I practice gratitude things will get better which means action will need to be taken, and action terrifies me these days. I fear if I continue to perpetuate this mindset and continue to reside in my suffering I won’t make it much longer. So let’s practice some gratitude, we can do it together. 🙂",BlueFox0627,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttbaur/today_feels_heavy/

I'm terrified about talking about my struggles and emotions,"All of my problems seem small, yet I struggle much more than I think I should with them. I've lived a good life, I think, so that makes me feel guilty for being depressed and that my emotions and struggles aren't valid. I know there are people out there who have been through so much worse than me, so I feel like I shouldn't be depressed. I've felt alone for most of my life. My parents worked a lot and often had to travel, so I didn't see them much. I never had close friends for more than a few years due to moving schools or out of state all the time. I think this caused me to not tell anyone how I was feeling because I was never asked, and it was never brought up in conversation, so I just assumed people didn't talk about their feelings. In high school, I met a girl who changed me. We started as friends for a few years, and then we dated for several years. She taught me so much about the world that I had never experienced. I never listened to music, watched TV or movies, or even went to spend time with friends because it was foreign to me, and I didn't think that people would care about me. I eventually started to open up and tell her about how I was suicidal for a long time, and I was planning on killing myself the day I met her, but she was the one who changed that. We eventually broke up, which was a complicated situation, but I'll give the short version. We were both very busy with school and college and we didn't have much time to see each other. One day, she confessed that she had feelings for one of her other friends but took it back the next day. We eventually decided it would be best for both of us to focus on school and work for a few months but still keep in touch. She eventually started dating the person she said she had feelings for, and I'm still heartbroken. She was the only person I ever felt close to. I've tried going to several therapists and taking antidepressants but nothing is helping much. For a long time, even before college, I considered suicide after I graduated college because I had no idea what I wanted to do or who I wanted to be. I've been out of college for a few months now, and I haven't found a job or figured out what i even want to do with my life. My friends and family only reached out a few times after we broke up, but I always got interrupted or belittled when I was trying to explain how I was feeling. I'm terrified of telling people how I'm truly feeling, especially around the topic of suicide. I'm worried I would be judged or treated differently. I dont know who to talk to anymore because the one person who actually seemed to care has moved on.",camsmitty24,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttfbjh/im_terrified_about_talking_about_my_struggles_and/

I realized that we hang out, everything is fine and good, but if I leave, the conversations become much more interesting.

I hate that depression has taken away so much from me.,"I finished college in 2020, I just wanted a way out in life a break from school and no longer having to worry about going back because I can't afford it anyway. I am recently going to start my very first job soon at a grocery store which im happy about but theirs something else I wanted to do ever since I thought about it. I wanted to join the airforce after graduating college because it's something I wanted to do unfortunately In college I was going through a extremely hard time I was harassed by a guy my last two semesters of college and he stole my book bag.

I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life I changed my degree I don't know how many times and because of my family life I just wanted to move on from it all because of me coming from a very dark and traumatic childhood. Especially because a lot of it was when I was in school but anyways I wanted to use the military (air force) as a way to finally move up in life and be able to do more things be more independent and social not only that be able to be financially stable and be able to actually afford being independent and on my own.

Unfortunately my depression took that away from me to you see around that year of college when the guy stole my book bag I started taking medication for my depression because of the relentless of it, and around this time I wasn't thinking about the military I just wanted to do school and that's it.

Until I started looking into it and thought this is it this is how I'll be able to afford being independent and be able to consistently do more things and keep my brain busy not only that I live in a extremely small town theirs not that many opportunities for work here unless you move and have a partner to help you and are financially stable (which I don't have neither).

Anyways I recently got off my medication and in August it would have been one full year I've had my medication off and even then thats not enough unfortunately from what I've been told. Unfortunately  for me I don't have that many options like my friends do because they all have partners and people to move in with (siblings) and I don't have that.... the one thing I had in my life to finally turn it around and be able to do more things and it gets taken away from me because of a disease and I hate it....

Not only that theirs not that many career options here either and I can't afford to go to college because I don't want to go Into debt for a degree and have to pay back student loans...


I'm just hurt and lost because this was my last damn chance it was I'm not joking about this if I did have more options to choose from I wouldn't have thought about going into the military.

My life has been a snowball,"My fight with depression started in sixth grade when I found out that my school's staff were (most likely) bribed by the bullies at the school. What do I mean by that? I mean that the school's staff were paid to not talk to the bullies and tell them to stop. How do I know this?

There are two reasons why I KNOW that the staff were being bribed.

1: When I asked the principal to deal with some assholes, he didn't get around to it (even after OVER A MONTH!)

2: One day, when I was walking up to my homeroom, I saw a friend of mine crying to a staff member about how my friend got pick-pocketed.

Why do I mention the second one?

Because the staff said...and I quote: ""It probably just fell out"".

Fell out of vertical pockets...with no holes in them.

This proves that the staff were bribed, or that the staff were dumber than bricks!

That's what pushed me over the edge, and led to my first of MANY suicide attempts. Many years later, I got my first girlfriend...and then I fucked it up and broke up with her over a misunderstanding.

I fucking hate myself for breaking up with her how I did, and because I did.

I (M 25) honestly haven't really felt the same since the lock-downs in March 2020. I was having the time of my life in college, and then it was all ripped away from me and I finished my last semester in my bedroom on a computer .... 

I was planning on doing a gap year after graduating, and traveling around the world or applying to Peace Corps. Obviously that hasn't been a possibility until recently (2022). But I just have kinda lost part of myself. I had all kinds of aspirations and ideas and things i wanted to do with my life. 

I haven't had the desire to date, or hook up, or even hold a conversation with another person since 2020. I mean, I do at work and everything to just get by, but when I am on my own walking the city streets, I just don't feel like interacting with people. I don't call up any of my friends from college, I just feel so removed from so much .... 

And I have been focusing on the flaws of my body, like my bad acne scars on my face, and I am more of a lean body type with thin arms, so I dont feel like much to look at. and holy fuck, how am I already 25 years old? I feel light years behind people my age. I have been working part time at a job that pays $15 an hour..... and my living situation is a hybrid of hostels and staying at home.

Why,"Depression, major anxiety, adhd and major problems with abandonment from not 1, not 2 but 3 different dads leaving my family.

I’m really scared,"I used to be the most bubbly and happiest person you would know. I’ve always had a go getter attitude and was always happy, no matter how gleam things were. Never in my young teenager days did I ever consider offing myself and never thought I could understand that kind of pain for someone. Never did I see the screwed up parts of the world; I was always looking for good. 


I fell in love. I really fell hard. I’ve never been so in love in my life. I want to spend the rest of my days with this man. I knew bad and good about him and chose to still love it all. I was so smitten by him. He is so charismatic, he’s fun, he’s random and I loved that cause it was always an adventure. 



He loved me. He proposed to me pretty quickly cause we were best friends for a long time before. I knew he would propose. Of course I said yes. I never had a doubt that he was the one and only. I was on top of the world. So high up that no one could bring me down. 



I got pregnant. We weren’t ready but we were in it together. We moved in together and it really wasn’t hard to be with each other so much. I never grew tired of him, all I wanted was to be around him in any spare moment possible. 



With a baby on the way, he stepped up. Big time. He joined the army for us. For our family. He made it to where I didn’t have to work and I could be with our beautiful daughter. I’m so grateful. He was the man I needed and the father my daughter needed. We got married before he had to leave for basic training. We only ever thought of each other through that tough time apart. I wrote so many letters. I’d tell him everything I possibly could. He told me about basic and how much it sucked but he would look at pictures of me and push himself to the limits. I always believed in him; even when his own family didn’t. I’ve believed in him all the time.


He finally came back. He was different but in the best ways. The army changes you to make you a soldier and he was the guy to do it. He did it. I was so proud. He got stationed far away from home. We both came together for this journey. To be on our own, to make it. To have this family and be together through thick and thin. I’d happily go anywhere with him. I just was happy to be with him in this world, and wanted to love him, see him be a father. He’s a great dad. He loves his kid. He would do anything for her. 



Things started going for the worse about a year ago. I didn’t want to think I was depressed in that time but I probably was. I found out about him emotionally cheating. It broke me. He talked to quite a lot of women by the time I found out. It hurt really bad but I guess I convinced myself that he wouldn’t ever physically act on it so I wanted to believe we can work from here. It continued. And it’s not only the cheating, but also him being a compulsive liar. He would lie about a lot of things that would just be more difficult to come clean about. We always talked about this stuff. Always told him I’d rather know the truth even if it hurts. I was always under the impression that when we finished our fight or conversation that we finally came down to a conclusion or compromise. It didn’t stop. The lying is still here. The cheating happened way too many times for a person to continue giving chances, but I did anyway. Like I said, I believed in him. I know he loves me. I believed he could do it for me. 


He wasn’t a very open guy about his past or any emotions he really has. From the start he let me aware that he has trust issues so he would have to slowly build that with me. I didn’t mind. I was always honest. I never lied, I never cheated, I was the best. I did my best and prioritized making him comfortable and willing. He’s told me quite a bit of stuff that not many others know about him. I love that he got to that point with me. It brings us closer together and that’s what I wanted. 


I may understand depression a bit better than before, but I know he’s been struggling with depression and other mental issues a lot longer than me. He has wanted to die. He tried to die. His depression has still been with him all along. I didn’t always see it cause I was happy and he was happy. But he was struggling. After a bit of dealing with the cheating stuff, he came to the idea that maybe something mentally is really affecting him that has led him to do it. Y’all might not agree, but knowing this man, I can believe that. He started going to therapy. I’m so proud of him for finally going. Eventually we we’re both supposed to get marriage counseling, but I guess we never made it that far. We needed it and I stressed that to him. It’s probably to late to start now but him being in therapy is pretty important. He has a lot more to work on with himself since most of our big problems were the cause of him. And he deserves to be in a better place. Him getting in a better place, I truly believe would put us in a better place. I would always want the best for him. I love him and still do. 


I can’t tell if I’m at my final straw. If you want to read back to my last post, our breaking point is about that. Things didn’t play out as they should’ve. I became very angry. I wanted him to prove to me one thing that should’ve been easy enough so I can actually build back my trust with him. 


All I ever wanted was to have trust again. It doesn’t feel good that for the past year I can’t trust a damn thing. He knows it and I’ve basically given him the guide book to get us back in a place that would be better for us both. I feel like the guide book wasn’t even skimmed. I still believed that eventually he would think that he doesn’t want to deal with this crap anymore and try to attend to me in those ways I needed. He’d be there at the very bottom line when I needed him but it seemed like it always had to get to that point for him to do so. It was just because he knew it needed to change to keep me and that was enough in those moments. I’m sure he knew even then that it should be more than that but that’s all he could manage. 


I know he loves me very much. He wouldn’t be doing most of the things he is doing if he didn’t love me. He sacrificed himself into the army for us. He continues to be the sole bread winner of the house so I can be a stay at home mom. He comes home everyday to us. He spends time with his daughter and spends time with me. We only struggle with these issues said. Other than that, we both love each other and we both start the day and end the day with one another. It’s filled with love all the time day to day. We always tell each other I love you. We cuddle together and do what any normal married couples would. Other than our issues; it would seem like we are like in our 40’s kind of couple. We are comfortable. If one has to use the bathroom, the other is right there just to continue the conversation. We shower together, and it’s not sexual, it’s just to shower. We talk about our future together, where we will live, what we will end up doing once our daughter is grown up and moved out. Him being in the army, I’m prepared to go anywhere it would take us. I knew I’d be with him and our family we created so it was gonna be okay. And even if he wasn’t gonna be in the army forever,  I would be here and we would work out the next part of our lives. 


I still want it so bad. He doesn’t realize the power he holds over me. My life is in his hands. I don’t want us to end cause I’ve always believed. He’s let me down many times but I still believe he could do so much better. We are still young. He’s 21 for crying out loud but I know he’s had to mature a lot faster to provide for his family. I wanted to wait out some years for him to treat me better, for him to understand the importance of what I ask. I wanted to wait for overall everything to be better. No body is perfect and even I’m not perfect but I’ve done my best. I see the importance in the issues he has with me and I tend to those things cause I wouldn’t want to hurt the one I so much love and care for. I don’t want to go, but I’m afraid I’m kinda forced to. I always told myself, I’d know when I’ve had enough. I feel like I should be at that point but I just want us so bad. 


I have never felt so in love with someone before. I actually envision us growing old together. I want us to be able to be there and say we made it, we did it. I want our daughter to grow up with both her parents so in love with each other and both of them to be in her life. His family has a bunch of co parenting going on but I don’t want that to be us. I want the best of all the times of a mother a father and a child together. I don’t want to see him move on and maybe be with someone else happily and doing all the things I have been asking for. I want that to be me. I don’t want to co parent where we just on a level of just here for the kid but not each other.


As much as we are young, we have invested a lot in each other. It might be easy to say “you’re young, you’re too young to just settle” I didn’t ever want a different man. I wanted my man to be the man I needed him to be. I need him and I still very much want him. I wish I could still be here but just fast forward to him being everything I ever wanted and needed. I was there for him in his worst times. I want to be with him through any other hardships he were to experience. He was there for me. I’ve probably felt suicidal 3 times including now and he was there for me before. He knows I’d never be able to. The only thing wanting me to stay is to be with my daughter. I love her with everything I am. I want to see her grow up. I wouldn’t dare take my life because of her. I just wish I could’ve done something more so she could have both her mom and dad but I did everything I could. I wanted to show her what love is supposed to look like. I wanted her standards of love to be amazing, because love really is beautiful. I fear that my husband is just so used to toxic. I strived so hard for healthy, and I think even he could’ve learned along the way what healthy can be. We had pretty good communication. He used to never want to go to bed angry. We we’re both stubborn but even we both have taken our pride away just to come together. 


I’m afraid that I’ll either just let it slide again just to still be with him, or I will leave and have to start from the ground up. We have almost divorced before. Starting as a stay at home mom I’d have to get a job and figure out daycare and do everything alone. I know it can be done but heartbreak is so different with an innocent child involved. I’d have to push down my pain to make it. I still have to be there for her. I’d have to say goodbye to the one I love and strive to make up the difference for my kid. I wanted so much for her. I wanted so much for all of us. 



I hope he can make it out of his dark place. He deserves more than what he’s been given. I wish I could just make his mental struggles and pain to go away. If he wasn’t cursed with it, he would be so amazing. I believe that with everything in me. I wish he could’ve done it for himself so he could do the right things for me. I wish his mind wasn’t against him. I wish his mind believed in him like I do. He could do anything he set his mind to if he could only have that pain taken from him. 


I love him. I wish there was more I could’ve done but there really isn’t. I feel so defeated. I wonder if he’s the winner here. I wonder if this is what he wanted but he couldn’t bring himself to just call it off. It doesn’t excuse what he did but I just never wanted this to happen. I would give up anything to just try again and erase my mind of all this pain, and for him to try again and be better this time. Sadly I will always carry this with me. I just wish I was enough to make him want it as badly as I did.",Juic_yjenny,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tt3gc1/im_really_scared/

Life advice and hope.,"I don't know if it fits in here or not but I fell in love with someone, let's call he Daisy for simplicity sake. I was head over heals in love, unfortunately 6 months late she didn't feel the same way and she wasn't ready for a relationship bit she started dating someone a few weeks later.

It was a rude awaking for me I thought she would like me for me but end of the day everyone is a bit superficial, since I lose her in my life, not that I ever had her even though I confessed my love for her I was just not what she wanted.

I've dropped 3 stone, toned myself up, and tried to move on since here sister let's call her Holly told me not to talk to her again which is fair. 8 don't believe I will ever fall in love again as it is heartbreak waiting to happen but I wish daisy the best in her future relationships.

For all those looking for love  don't it hasn't helped me, the best you can hope for is for someone who sees you for your positive rather than what breaks you.

Smiling is a pain just a way to  fake my feelings

I've realized my suffering stems from something way deeper than just depression.,"Ive been thinking about this a lot lately and I think I've come to the conclusion that I'm not just depressed, my issues exist in a more primordial and radical way.

The core of my suffering is the desire of nothing, but being forced to live a normal life.

I simply do not have desires, I don't want anything from life, I don't care for success or happiness, I just want to be left alone in nothing.

People have dreams and aspirations, I have none of that, that's why antidepressants don't work on me, it's because I'm not depressed, I'm completely dead inside.

This explains everything, this explains my poor academic performance and my ever-failing relationships,
I just don't care, I never did.

I'm just an empty husk trying to fit in, and even if I'm successful at acting human, at the end of the day I'm no one, who strives for nothing.

This is it.

""There are no more barriers to cross. All I have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward it I have now surpassed. My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others. I want no one to escape, but even after admitting this there is no catharsis, my punishment continues to elude me and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself; no new knowledge can be extracted from my telling. This confession has meant nothing.""",thethrowawayguy82,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tt7iz2/ive_realized_my_suffering_stems_from_something/
Am I wrong for wanting to keep my distance from my boyfriends brother?," 

Long story short. I went on a week long vacation with my boyfriend, his brother and his brothers gf. The first night his brother took my car without asking to take his gf to Mcdonalds. Mind you we were sleeping, he stole it, and we were in North Carolina. We live in South Florida, he did not know where my insurance or registration was. He just took my car .This is my only car.. I use it for work, I use it for everything (His brother does not have a car ) they eventually came back right when we woke up. I didn't know what happened until my bf told me. He told me not to say anything to his brother. which really upset me. I stormed out of the room, my bf followed I almost broke up with him. He finally started to feel bad about it. Called his brother out on his behavior at which his brother proceeded to laugh at us in our face called me an ""ugly thing"" ..I was so upset i sat in my car for two hours. I knew if his brother or the girlfriend said anything to me I would get into an altercation. So I kept my distance. The next day ... we arrived at the cabin, they started complaining about not having any food. My boyfriend was sick, so guess who was forced to take them to Walmart. Me..... i did not get an apology... nothing, their mom called to ask the brother and the girlfriend if they were okay.. Didn't even say sorry for her sons behavior..

I decided that I would keep my distance, remain calm the whole trip. So I stayed in the room the entire time. I overheard the brother telling my boyfriend that it was best for him to dump me ..so he could hang out with him and his 20 year old gf. Who i overheard talking crap about my looks, wanting to scratch my face off ..I don't know what I did. I let them use my car to drive to North Carolina. I contributed to the trip. I was very nice. I have tried to befriend the girlfriend only to have this happen. I told my boyfriend I really do not want to be around his brother and the girl anymore. My boyfriend understands... But I feel terrible.",COCOLOKA,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttccmb/am_i_wrong_for_wanting_to_keep_my_distance_from/
How do I know when it's time to seek out professional help?,"Hi everyone, I'm not sure if this is the right community to put this in so please correct me if not.

I've been struggling with depression as far back as I can remember due to a bad childhood, abusive situations, etc. I had a really long streak without any major depressive episodes or feelings, lasting from early April 2021 to early January 2022. But since then it has become extremely bad. I barely go to college, see my friends, and recently even broke up with my boyfriend due to my mental health.

I feel like recently everybody has been turning hostile towards me, everything has been spiraling and I cannot grab a hold of anything on my way down. I don't even have the urge to self-harm, and I don't think I want to end it all, but at the same time if an accident were to happen and kill me it wouldn't upset me whatsoever. I just want it all to stop. I hate my life and myself and I feel like a waste of air most of the time. I just feel as though I do more bother than good. I want to sleep and not wake up the next morning.

The thing is, I don't actually want to kill myself by my hand, which puts me off seeking professional help. I'm making an appointment with my doctor to discuss my extreme anxiety soon, and I'm unsure if I should mention how I feel. Is this something I should bring up to a professional or will it just sort itself out?",irlavatar,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttc8qc/how_do_i_know_when_its_time_to_seek_out/

Reincarnation,"I grew up religious. Even though my family was pretty secular about it, I used to have this childhood memory of someone, an aunt, telling me very sternly that I should never wish to be dead because one day I’ll become happy and god will grant me that wish. Saying I wish I was dead is like second nature now. But it wasn’t always like this. The funny thing is I say it when I’m most frustrated. I still have trouble understanding how depression works. But lately I’ve begun to believe that reincarnation is possible and now I don’t really care like at all. Before I was secretly passively suicidal. Like if I get sick I’m not gonna go to the hospital. Now it’s like oh well it doesn’t matter I’ll just come back in another life. It has made me more I guess accepting of it. It’s fine if I die because I’ll just come back in another life.

I have no energy and I need to hit the pause button,"First off I want to say I've been making a lot of progress in my life, but for the last week or two I've just felt like I've fallen off the tracks. 

I am super unmotivated at my job. I put things off and I am cynical about the whole thing. I don't get paid nearly enough but at the same time I probably don't work hard enough to get paid any more than I do. Still, I know there are people lazier than me who make twice as much. 

I'm also working on my masters degree. I have about 2 more months, so I am getting close. However, I feel like I've hit a wall. I just have zero motivation to study. Its all online and self paced so its very easy for me to just put things off. I know I'll finish, but I have not energy or desire to study at this point. 

I'm in a relationship that is going pretty well, but at the same time there are some things I think could be better and I feel like the other person is not willing to make compromises, which is causing me to feel resentful. Perhaps the true cause of this is the fact that I suck at standing up for myself and negotiating. If I state something I think needs to change I'm so fearful it'll cause the relationship to end I start to have a panic attack. This obviously isn't very attractive. 

I have several things around my house that need taken care of. There are a bunch of other things I need to do and I just put them off. All I do is sit on the couch and stare and my phone and watch dumb YouTube videos. I do this thinking I'll get up and do something in 10 minutes but all of the sudden its 1 in the morning and I've been doing that for 4 hours. 

I'm in my 30s and I'm lazier than I was when I was in high school. This feels unacceptable to me and I'm afraid others will notice as well. 

I honestly feel like I need to go sit in a cabin in the woods for a month and not do anything whatsoever. Maybe take my dog but nothing else. 

Anyway, just needed to vent. Thanks for reading.

I fell to the rock bottom and I'm only 17,"I am 17,M. I've been anxious my whole life and depressed since I was 12. In my early stages of life I was a fat kid, I would always get laughed at for being overweight, for being ugly, I always felt like I was being judged. All of this got me to the point where I became socially anxious and depressed, by the age of 14 I tried weed, I never really enjoyed it because of the paranoia I'd get after smoking it. My mom found a little weed I had and things started escalating pretty fast. I'd get grounded, it would be very hard for me to ask my parents for anything, even like $5 or something, even thought it was hard for me to ask that before my mom found my weed, it never got this hard (This was in July/August of 2019). In September of 2019 I got into a high school(I'm from a rural area so this was a very big change in my life since I had to go to the nearest city),new people, scared of everything. I was lucky I became a friend with one guy from the class, even though there were people that went to the middle school with me I always felt like I didn't have anybody by my side. At that time I was really depressed and anxious, I was doubting everything, I started working out, lost around 15kg, got in some kind of a shape but it never really boosted my self esteem or anything, I was still anxious and depressed kid, thinking about suicide every other day. By the time COVID started I got off the social media, deleted and deactivated everything, I was in touch with only 2 friends, I started to think positively, I did my best to lower my anxiety and to not be depressed. I was kind of successful with that, by the time of the 2nd high school year I had some self esteem, but still when we'd go somewhere to drink coffee or to have a beer I'd constantly feel judged, my hands would start to shake and I'd be stuck in my thoughts, not knowing what to do. I'd reach out to some people, talk with them about how I feel but I never really got the help I needed, I always felt like I'd be judged by my friends if I asked them for help. It got to the point where I tried my best on my own. There were some moments that made me more depressed or less depressed than I was before but it always got to the same stage every single time. Fast forward to June 2022, I was watching a local soccer match and my half cousin came that I didn't see in few years, we started talking about some stuff, and one thing to another it led me to smoke a joint with him, we smoked it and both went out ways. By the time I was going home, few hours later after smoking with him I found him and one of his friends smoking so I joined them, I smoked with them and I got so high that I was scared to go home, I somehow calmed my self and went home. I got home, walked past my mom, straight to my bedroom. I was laying on bed, thinking about thousand things at once till I fell asleep. Woke up, forgot about that and moved on. Fast forward to 4 days ago, my mom comes busting in my room, firstly joking around then asking about where I spend my money(basically I'd get around $40 a week or something like that, coffee is like $1.5/1.7 , sandwich is like $2.2 and u can eat like 2 of them and still eat one more, beer is $2.7) (also keep in mind that I come to the city at 6:40AM and my school doesn't start till 7:15AM so I have more than half an hour to drink a coffee) I tell her honestly how I spend my money and she doesn't believe it. I tried convincing her, didn't work. She also asked me about my weed consumption, I froze for a second and lied to her, I told her that I haven't smoked since she found my weed. She believed me after some time of convincing her. The next day was going pretty normal but around 8:30PM she came busting into my room, yelling at me making sure I told her the truth, that she heard differently, I'm looking at her, thousand thoughts going thru my head, not knowing what to say, I lie to her again, she screamed at me told me that my half cousin said that he is worried about me(he tried committing suicide and had some serious episodes from his life going thru his head), I'm sitting looking at her, she runs away, comes back and I'm like ""Okay, I smoked once more than half a year ago"", she bursts in anger, yells at me, slaps me everywhere she can, leaves my room , yelling how I'm going to kill her with this stuff, that she will just pack up and leave. Eventually I gather enough fear, I came to her and told her everything how I felt for the last 5-6 years, told her about my anxiety, about my depression, about stuff I never ever told anyone because I was ashamed of myself. Told her to that I was scared to ask for her to get me a psychiatrist, we probably talked for about 2 hours about stuff I never talked about with her. That day.. my mental health that I was working so much on, trying so much to get it better just,  I don't know, it just all hit me again, everything that I worked on came back to me. It hurts me so much knowing that something I worked on for the past 2 years had been destroyed in matter of seconds, but it hurts me even more that my mom doubts everything I say, no matter how honest I am, no matter what, she doesn't believe me anything. I just feel like my life ain't worth it. I just feel like I am some kind of a bacteria that's destroying people. My emotions are soo messed up right now.

I want to die again,"A few months ago I had suicidal thoughts and I got better for a bit, but now I want to die again. There aren't really good reasons why I want to die, I was happy a few weeks ago, but i just feel empty, not important, and like I go through everyday and achieve nothing. I have no motivation but quite a bit of time. Last time I felt this crappy, my parents said they signed me up for therapy through my dad's work (his union has a therapy thing), but there's been no updates, no dates, nothing. My sister was feeling super bad like she wanted to die a few weeks ago and my stepmother said that they could go to a therapy place right in the morning, which made me feel worse since I had to wait and she did not. My mental state has been decreasing for a short amount of time, but has quickly made me back to the hole where I tried to dig out of so much.

Sometimes fuck you world,"hello pips,

today was not a good day, but it turn into something i like, because i think ""fuck you world"" i was emotional wrecked and now im happier.

Its such a relief to make progress in the therapy and write/talk down i do not like. Sometimes i think ""fuck you family"" you never listen u think only about yourself. 

I hated it so much if i have a problem and my family answer to my problem with ""and what is with me?"" what is wrong with you? Are you the child or i? I have needs as a child and you were responible for that. And you ignored my needs all day long. My Father never ask how we are. He drink with my mother like every second day and forget about us. My brother said once ""we live a seperate live from my parents"" and yeah he is right at all. The family i wish never existed. And im sick to care about people, who do not want change themselve and only use me as a emotional trash can. 

Its stops, THEY have to change. I can do nothing at all. Everytime it hits me, that i want to help and be patiently, but if they want help or talk with me, then they get my opinion in return. 

I understand if people want to talk so do i. 

What also makes me sick is that i do not have a clue what i want do with my life. I wander around and think about ""makes this sense?"" But this is not my thoughts. I Enjoy doing weird stuff and beind weird. I do not like overthinkg everythink and not everythink has a purpose. 

What i understand if people want directly correct me is, that they have control issues. Their thoughts are black and white, right and wrong. But no nothing living thing in this fucking planet can say its right or wrong. 

One question i have in my head. Can you detect people who are good for you? And what is your feeling? what is that are you searching in others?

How much anti-depressants changed me overnight,"I have not had an easy life. I was neglected in my childhood and grew up to be extremely insecure and eventually depressed.

Last year, after a year of therapy, my therapist and I decided to put me on SSRIs after nothing seemed to work while I was coming out of a very difficult marriage. From what I have understood from my psychologist who prescribed me the medication, it wasn’t a high dosage either.

My worldview began to change shortly after. I started noticing more wholesome people and things around me. It changed my perspective for almost everything. Loneliness started turning into solitude. Everything that I was learning during therapy became easy to apply in my life. I had no idea I needed them so badly. It also led me to my current SO who is, in my opinion, the most wholesome person ever.

After being on SSRIs for almost 9 months, I started being careless with them. I felt like I didn’t really need them and started taking them if I’d remember to. 

Last Wednesday, the first most devastating thing happened to me since my divorce. My 10 month old kitty jumped out of the window of my apartment and got away. I had adopted him after my divorce got finalised and I fell in love with this little ball of fur. Me and my SO searched everywhere but to no avail. SO tried to calm me down and stayed over that night to make sure I eat and sleep well. He kept saying that I need to be calm and control my emotions if I want to find Milk. He said that bawling my eyes out is not going to help in finding him. I just couldn’t understand how he was expecting me to be calm and eat and sleep like nothing happened.

The first day following that incident, I was in shock and still couldn’t register what had happened. Somehow got through the first night and the morning after, I had a lot of things to do. Since I chipped Milkshake, I had to report him missing to the authorities so that if his chip is scanned anywhere in the country, I will be notified. That night my SO brought over posters to stick around my neighbourhood informing people my kitty was missing.

As I was sticking the last poster, I broke down. I knew that after I put this up, there’s nothing more I can do to find him except of course walk around the neighbourhood hoping to spot him. As I was walking towards home, I could literally feel my heart breaking into a million pieces. Nothing felt good. I found myself wishing I die. The pain was intolerable. My SO happened to call me in that moment to check on how I was doing and I almost didn’t answer the call. I just didn’t think anything could make it better. 

He heard me crying through the phone and decided to come over for the night even with me saying I don’t think it was needed. I felt a wave of relief knowing I wasn’t going to be alone that night. In that moment, I knew I had to start taking my medication again. I took a 10mg dose that night.

The next morning, I woke up to a redditor telling me they thought they had seen a cat like mine somewhere nearby. As soon as I saw the message, I picked up my bike went over to that location, which was not a residential area. I thought the chances were it was my kitty since he could have easily walked that far. While biking around, I also found a residential area nearby and it hit me that it’s highly plausible that the kitty wasn’t even Milky to begin with. 

My heart broke once again. However, this time, it was different. I knew this time that I cannot get disappointed over this. I had bikes around for an hour and a half and still hadn’t found my cat. I had also neglected work for the past two days and I had a very important work meeting in an hour and a half.

In that moment, the fog disappeared and I felt okay. I thought of Blizzard and I wanted to go back to him. I wanted to make sure I was there to attend that work meeting so I don’t end up losing my job. I felt like I wanted to live and be ready for Milkshake in case I find him.

It’s a world of difference I felt before and after taking my anti-depressants and I promised myself to not miss a dose again. At least for now.

I started to wonder how much everyone would benefit from the medication since so many of us are depressed without even knowing.

Today is day 7 since my little baby went missing and I have hope in my heart. I think I am kinder to others and softer on myself because I understand how much we are all suffering.

How Long Does It Take To Be Able To Lose Weight Again After Discontinuing An Anti-Psychotic?,"I begged my psychiatrist not to put me on anything for my depression that would interfere with my metabolism. She swore up and down Latuda would not cause me to gain weight. 

And it didn’t. But I’ve been on Nutrisystem for over two weeks now and have not lost any weight. The first week allows for only 1000 calories and then the calorie count only goes up to 1475. 

I have stuck to the diet religiously plus light-moderate exercise and have lost no weight in 15 days. I. Am. Furious. With. The. Psychiatrist. I threw the Latuda in the garbage yesterday once I finally caught on. 

My question now is- how long is this nightmare going to go on? While I’m not clinically obese I’m very overweight and don’t feel that I can present myself to the world like this. I cry constantly and have bad anxiety now because of what this doctor did to me. 

If anyone has information to share about how long antipsychotics ruin your body for, please share. I can’t live like this. 

Being overweight is at least as depressing as anything else I’m depressed about. Much more actually. I gained this weight to begin with from a different psych med.

Help partner just diagnosed with early depression.,"Hey guys! 
I am sorry what you are experiencing, I know that it is a struggle, it is real and it is hard.
I come here for your advice.

So my boyfriend who was also diagnosed a long ago with PTSD and whose symptoms were controlled started do become aggressive at any disagreement we had. Any time I said I did not like something it led him to break me up and to make me responsible for all. 

Yes I do have my part but it cannot statistically be my entire fault. I do have ADHD and as for fights I cannot pay attention, he started to treat me as a disabled person or a dumb one.
So, two weeks ago we were fighting and things went to a whole new level, he shouted me, he verbally abused me and threat me, there he was kicking stuff.
He blocked me from everything and disappeared after shouting he did not wanted to be with me anymore.

So on this week I wrote him, his first response was to tell me how I was responsible for everything, then he texted me a narrow apology about his shouting and insults. I answered that it was important to not minimized what happened because it was all wrong but I would not give him a label because of those two hours.

The next day he said in therapy he was told he has symptoms of early depression and for the first time he Thanked me because of my concern. 

I told him that although he has blocked me everywhere and he was rude and I am still mad I will be there because I know the importance of connecting and that since I do love him and I am thankful for those times he stood by me I will not take things that the depression has shouted me.

I need your advice, is there anything I could tell or do asides giving him spaces and telling this things to him?

I do love him and I now he is struggling, I have hopes on him returning, but if he takes another decision once all this passed I will be glad about it. For me now is important to show up and to show that I do care, time will tell us things.

"11 days in bed, struggling in my last semester","I've spent the last 11 days glued to my bed, with the exception of going to sports practice and occasionally forcing myself into work and class (happened 2 days for about 8 hours total). I do get up maybe once or twice a day to feed my cat and have a snack, definitely no full-on meals. I spend the day doomscrolling or sleeping, mostly sleeping.


I thought the sports practices were keeping me together a little bit, like holding onto a lifeline and getting me out of the house, but I've missed the last 3 days of practice now and am letting my team down. I'm withdrawing from everyone I know and even struggle to respond to professors who are reaching out about missing work. I did some damage control a couple of days ago, so that's a little better, but damn if I don't stop wasting away these days.


This is my last semester of college, I really just have to pull through, but I'm struggling pretty badly right now. So much guilt and shame over not leaving bed, not doing work, not responding to people, and now not showing up to practice. It's a viscious cycle. 


I have a therapy session tomorrow, in-person, so hoping I will myself to that. Actually, I will go to it, no exceptions. I desperately need it, I think, even though I'm feeling very apathetic.


To celebrate some small victories: 

- I took a shower last night for the first time in a while
- I made scrambled eggs yesterday morning
- I emailed important people a few days ago 
- I texted my coach and let her know I'm struggling with depression. Full transparency. And then proceeded not to respond to her response... gah, man, what are you doing??? Ok, ok, let's keep it positive
- I told a friend I was having a rough time. We text about once a day now
- Well, I made a therapy appointment for myself. It's recurring, so I don't know how much that counts, but I guess it counts a little. Thanks past me 
- I handed in a few overdue assignments. When I say overdue, I mean OVERDUE (like, one of them was a month, the rest are more 3-5 days)
- I sent in DSO accommodations for one of my classes that I was granted due to mental health issues
- I'm actively fighting self harm/suicidal thoughts and using some healthier coping skills (mostly distracting myself with my phone or sleep or cuddling my cat, tbh)",tigerflower21,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tsvrn8/11_days_in_bed_struggling_in_my_last_semester/

Is it always worth being friends with a depressed person?,"TLDR is the title.

I know the title sounds very brash, but let me explain myself. Also note that I do not have depression, so I don't have a firsthand understanding of it. I can only go by anecdotes and literature. And please feel free to educate me.

I (22M) am friends with K (19F). We met on OkC in January, tried to date twice, but she broke up with me both times, after a week. In her own words, she was lying to herself about being ready to date. 

She has had clinical depression basically all her life, in addition to ADHD, anxiety, insomnia, and deep traumas (therapists, sexual, men in general). Deep inside though, she is one of the most amazing people I know. We click quite a bit and share the same humor and interests.

I have never been friends with a depressed person before. I thought getting over my feelings for her was hard, but this is way more challenging. Throughout the past few months, I've just had many doubts over whether or not keeping this friendship is worth it.

She describes her depression as wearing a mask constantly, that can never come off. I've hung out with her 5 times, and she's always expressed how she had a blast, but it's quite emotionally draining for her.

Now this is the part that I know sounds quite selfish. I don't feel like my needs are met out of this friendship. I want someone that I can cuddle, do stuff with, and learn from. My mental health feels worse off with maintaining this friendship.

I have given her money without her ever asking. I gave her my old PS2 so she could relive the positive part of her childhood. She has always been appreciative of these things, though I understand that none of these things are guaranteed to make her feel better, short or long term.

I also talk with her best friend L (20F), who mostly just makes sure that I don't hurt K. (For context, K and I live close by, L is in another country). She also has a strong distrust in men and was extremely jealous of me when K and I dated. It feels toxic having L around, so that's another reason why I want to call off this friendship.

The way I see it, I have two choices: either I stick around for K and hope she gets better, or I put my own health first and find more positive friends to be with. Am I wrong for rather doing the latter?

ETA: I've told K in the past that I would be there for her, to which she says ""I appreciate it, but I think I'll reach out to L because I trust her more"". I can't help but feel like I'm being pushed away.",enriqueg9031,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tsyy2l/is_it_always_worth_being_friends_with_a_depressed/
I think of completely isolating myself,"I think of isolating myself in the house. Of living in poverty and eternal emptiness. I am a burden and I will never feel the other way, because I am.

A Guy Not Paying For A Date Makes me Feel Worthless...," A man and I matched on Tinder. We texted a little and things were going well so he suggested the idea of getting food with me.

I said ""sure"" and then he said ""Do you expect the guy to pay?"" and the obvious answer is YES because I know my worth, so I just ignored his text and started looking for other guys.

He then found me on social media and asked if I would let him ""take me out to dinner"". I said sure and we had an okay first date, however, he complained about the menu prices since he's from another city. We kissed anyway and he said he wanted to see me again.

Anyway, he then asked me out for a second date and I suggested a place nearby me. Again I spent hours getting ready, blew off a project I was doing for work, bought a new dress, and put on uncomfortable heels.

When the check came, he slid it over to me and demanded that I pay. His awful excuse was that I should pay because of ""equality"" (his excuse to be cheap). I started crying just because I really WANT a gentleman who will treat me the first few times, and be chivalrous.

The guy got really uncomfortable and he threatened to walk out and leave, and then started talking about how he had lots of other girls that ""wanted him"".

He then said we could ""split it"", but the restaurant came back and ended up charging my card the whole thing, and the guy had a smug look on his face, obviously happy that MY CARD was charged for BOTH dinners (80 dollars)!

I was absolutely disgusted and repulsed, as this guy NEVER indicated to me before the date that it would be on me or he would split it, I thought that he genuinely liked me and would be happy to pay for the first few dates.

In hindsight, I feel like an IDIOT as the text about whether I expected the man to pay and him complaining about prices on the first date was a red flag. Am I right for dropping this guy, or AITA for crying and ghosting him after this second date? I feel like the fact he didn't pay means he thinks I'm not worthwhile :(",Equivalent-Amount-47,13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ttd77y/a_guy_not_paying_for_a_date_makes_me_feel/
I am not myself anymore," 

 I am 35 M and over the last few years I felt worse and worse. It feels like I am stuck in time and the world around me has moved onwards. The worst thing is these days I am in a really bad mood most of the time and people realize that. I don't want to be a dick, I don't want to be an asshole, yet I feel totally unable to communicate with others at that point. Thing is there are times where I can talk to anyone just like a normal person and these people are super friendly and I realize I'd probably be friends witht hem or something like that. But the at other times my depression kicks in, I feel in a super bad mood and I keep destroying these potential relationships to other people because I stop acting normal. It's like a curse and the worst thing is I am aware of it, yet I feel like it's a curse, like I can't do anything about it. :( Often I dream about a better leife, an alternate life where I am not like this, where I wouldn't feel depressed and thus have a great social life. But it feels like the weight of this world or rather the weight of my own decisions is too heavy to lift most of the times. I struggle with myself, all the time. It's like a shadow, a darkness inside of me.

I don't behave anymore like I used to, I'm not my usual old self anymore. It's like I am but a shell of my former self. The person people get to know these last few years is not myself anymore. It's someone else, someone even I despise. It's like I'm driven by someone else, as most of the times I feel like being trapped in my own body and a mind that is engulfed in a dark shadow. It's really hard to describe. All I can tell you is that I don't want anyone else to feel like that. You know what hell really is? Not a place inhabited by demons as described in any stories but it's this feeling you have when you know you are not yourself anymore, that the despression changes you into someone else and you hate that person and that life and you feel helpless since you can't do anything to change that. I tried to, many times and yes, there are some days that are better than others. But overall the state of mind I'm in feels like a life spent in hell.

The worst thing is you see other people who have no problems finding new friends or even a new partner in life and you even ""get it"", you understand how they do it, why they are so popular and beloved but you feel helpless and powerless because you're influenced by this shadow, this depression. You know you could potentially lead a totally different life but you can't. It's so hard for people to understand since they are not in this very specific mindset and as I mentioned I don't want anyone to feel like that but it's really terrible. It's like my old happy self, the person I used to be is trapped inside my body that feels like a vessel to a different person.",Slit08,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tsysq4/i_am_not_myself_anymore/

No hope… and a lot of anxiety,"I’m not sure if I’m depressed or if I’m feeling it, since I don’t really like defining what I’m feeling while being extremely biased probably. But I’ll explain away.

I have finished school 2 years ago, but I’ve never done high school. I’m the country I am in the school ends at 9th grade, basically at the age of 15/16. They make you choose what you want to do in life at 12/13, since that’s the time you enter secondary school which lasts for 3 years.

In this country I am in, school is only obligatory till 9th grade like I mentioned and their system goes around getting something called an “apprenticeship”. Which is basically the furthering of education in this country, the thing is is that it’s equivalent to high school, except you work for 3 days and get paid less than minimum wage for the job you work in and go to school for 2 days.

I wanted to do cs (computer sciences) in an apprenticeship, but the likelihood of that happening is next to zero. Most cs apprenticeships require experience that you’ve already gathered. And in some cases they require you to have applied for a cs school and have at least been there for 2 years or so. 

Now you’re probably asking “Then why did yo not apply for the cs school?”. It’s because in the country I am in, I did not qualify due to Covid back in 2020, the grades of my class were cancelled and reimported onto the last semester of school. So I was never able to apply for it. And back then, I was interested in art and drawing so I didn’t apply. And now that I am in a 2nd tenth year, I can’t apply for it anymore. Since, they only allow people who are 1 year into 10th year.

And the 10th year I am doing, isn’t even a 10th year. It’s an extra year so that you don’t waste your time at home and search for an apprenticeship, but the apprenticeship system is broken and isn’t reliable. Trying to finish high school is like trying to get a job without any sort of qualifications. Making it next to impossible to even continue education in this country. And in the school that I am forced to be in, I get bullied every day by 2 guys who won't stop touching me uncomfortably even though I have told them to stop. Once the teachers saw me almost crying and touched upon the matter and talked to the guys, and they began to increase the intensity of it. And you may be asking ""Why don't you leave? If you already finished school this should not be obligatory.""

For me to leave this school/10th year, I need to pay 800 pounds (converted from the currency from this country) in order to leave this school because-, NOTHING. They just said that in order to motivate the students to stay in school, they make you pay to leave it even though you alread finished school 1 year ago or so.

So, I spent my first year, of the 10th year working and going to school, and I was put in a really low end job, basically making candles 9 hours a day for 3 days a week, and going to the school they have for 2 days for 8 hours a day as well.

The job I did was horrifying, and I did not even get paid enough to do it, since in terms of what my country demands, it is not even enough to pay taxes, bills and health insurance. And it would be gone in 1 week or so, just from having to buy food in order to survive the week. 

I got really overworked and burned out, and back then I was really scared, anxious and depressed since I did not expect my life to go this way after secondary school since I thought I'd do at least 3 more years of school. But the worst part is that the extra years of school don't get you anything, they don't give you any courses that get you certificates nor does the school give you anything if you made good grades. And I did not learn anything new either, 10th years are not even really 10th years in this country, which made me really sad because I wasn't making progress.

I was really exhausted and sad back on my first year of 10th year, so I decided to pick up some hobbies and try to work my life back up again after new years.

After finishing that 1 year of extra school, I couldn't find an apprenticeship in design, so I decided to go for computer sciences since my girlfriend was in a cs school. After entering another year, I thought it was going to be different since it was in a different program, it was the 10th year full school, basically 5 whole days of school. But my expectations were betrayed, I picked the technical class since apparently they offered cs classes, but it was wrong. They don't actually offer any cs related activity. And in that class I was getting bullied and called names as well. I had to move to a different class since I was getting bullied, but the situation did not change much, in the new class I tried making friends but they thought of me as weird, and began bullying me as well.

I spent the entire 1st trimester learning in order to enter the cs school, since I couldn't apply with my grades due to covid, I had to do the exam, which was a 50/50 that I would pass it.
 
But after December, I got notified that I was not even allowed to take part in the exam for the cs school, which was still a 50/50 of whether I would get in. 

Around that time, I began feeling tired and burned out, my hobbies began feel tedious and I have been less and less productive as time went on. I tried finding alternatives to continuing education such as moving to another country, and or going back to my homeland.

I have been feeling hopless each day as it went on, I felt that I was so far behind in education and that I wasn't moving forward in anything. No matter what I did, I just felt more and more burned out and sad. It feels as if I have lost my new player priviliges and put in the hardest area in the game.

I am 17 years old as I am writing this, I hate how I have to make such a big decision of what I want to do so soon in my life and that I am not even given a chance to continue education. In the country I am in, I can't work without an apprenticeship, because any company in my country requires a certificate that you have done an apprenticeship and set region that you are trying to get a job in.

Which means I can't even work as a retail worker because there is an apprenticeship for that.

I am really tired, hopeless, burned out and anxious. Because, no matter what I do, I just feel really sad and tired as each day goes on and on, without moving forward one single bit. I don't know what to do, I can't get an apprenticeship since this country cock blocks itself and moving to my homeland will take at least a year because I will need to take down my health insurance and I can't live alone there.

But I noticed this last couple days I was seeking.. something I joined a dating app and used it for the first time and I've contemplated hookups which I never do.. I've also noticed just a desire for people. Idk if this is a sign my depression is just making my mind so beaten down by the main voice it hears it's seeking any nice contact or is it my subconscious way to say I need more good people or a relationship of some kind either in general or because of the negative thoughts.

Anyone else feel like they were born to be sad?,"I’ve recently been realising this about myself. I was recently talking to someone and they were asking me questions about myself and they noticed while I had answers for more specific and immediate questions, I did not have answers for bigger questions concerning my future. And so they asked, “So like do you not want to be alive?” It was the first time I felt so understood and misunderstood at the same time.

There are times when my life is enjoyable, I’m doing okay financially and I have a great support system and people who love me. It’s not that I don’t want to be alive. I like living.

But I’m always longing something. Idk what it is but it feels like something inside of me is missing. I fall into deep bouts of sadness and loneliness trying figure out what I’m looking for.

telling people your very depressed straight up doesn't work,"told a bunch of my friends in a gc point blank that i wanna die and i hate every thing about my life but nobody responded except for one person who asked if i'm alright in a direct message.

told another person over text in direct message cause he asked how i was doing but he responded with some ingenuine crap about how that sucks and all but hasn't talked to me in about 3 months since that message so i think he was just asking to be nice, not looking for the actual answer.

i don't tell people in person cause that's too much pressure in the moment. atleast over text they are given a chance to act like they didn't see it. if its in person there is too much pressure to act like you care so the response isn't genuine. that's why i know nobody gives a shit.

people don't care if i die other than my parents. even then its just cause they have to. the only reason i haven't killed myself is cause i'm too scared to and i hold out fear that maybe things actually might get better. (although i'm fairly sure it wont get better. like when you go on a night out and its shite but don't wanna go home cause maybe things will get better even though there is a very low chance that is going to happen) also i don't want my mom to be sad.

Music as my escape,"Hi. 

My main way of coping with my depression is to listen to music. I feel like it’s the only way I can get my emotions out and “on paper” without saying anything. 

I listened to the lyrics of Falling in Reverse’s Popular Monster, and got damn it hit me. 

“In breaking down, falling into love now, with falling apart”

That line hit me particularly hard. 

Coping with depression has put it in an almost erotic state for me. I romanticize it. It is almost as if I’m not falling apart, something’s wrong.

When will it stop? Never.,"I fucking hate my life and I hate my family and I hate my body and I just fucking hate living. I wish I could achieve everything I’ve ever dreamed of but it’s apparent I never will. As my family and friends have told me from the beginning I’m just a ducking failure and I’ll never be even as close to as great as any of them. 

All I wanted was to be happy and now I haven’t even achieved that. All my fuck ups and fucking bullshit was in persuit of happiness and now there all far happier than me. I got help for this disease I got medication and still I sit here balling my eyes out and fantasizing about opening my body up with a razor. I feel like they just sucked all of my happiness out of me like fucking snakes and now all 4 of them are the perfect humans with the perfect lives and I’ll never be there I’ll always just be the disappointment, the brother that didn’t live up to expectations, the fucking joke of the family. It wasn’t my fault but I did let it happen, I didn’t stand up to anything I jus let the abuse happen over and over and I kept telling myself I was fine. 

But I’m not fine, I’ll never be fine. All I do is just block out the pain like it’s not there and will never be there but it is. It’s a fucking constant in this life and I can’t avoid it. I really fucking can’t. No matter all the advice, therapy, good times I’ll never escape. The only real escape is the ultimate equalizer. Ending my suffering and letting it spread to them. Making them know what they did to me. Even my teacher and his fucking friend, I hope they find out and realize what they did. I want them all to know there part. I just wish I had the courage to do it. I hope when I do build up the courage that I dig that razor deep into my skin and cut every single vein, artery, and fucking let the blood flow. Let the suffering seep out until it finds its resting place in all the people who harmed me. 

I would feel bad for my girlfriend and my other friends but I hope they would understand. I hope they would know that I did it for good reason and if they didn’t then fuck they weren’t good friends. I just want it to end. I just want to be normal. I just want to have fucking peace in my mind.

But those are unachievable goals, at-least if I’m living.

I don’t have a title,"I’m 28 y/o, F, depressed, living in filth (even though it depresses me further), work a stressful professional low-paying job, etc etc etc. 

I checked my mail today for the first time since January and had a notice from the post office. 

I’m dating someone (26, M) who doesn’t quite understand depression (but tries). He’s outgoing and when I’m depressed, I’m not. And I’m always depressed. 

Last weekend we went out of town for his friends birthday. 45 minutes into arriving I blacked out and punched myself in the face and other horrible episodes so loudly and in front of everyone. 

I’ve been depressed since I can remember, but horribly depressed since 2018. Like unable to maintain a clean apartment or check my mail depressed, won’t let anyone come over depressed. I’ve never hurt myself. And I did it in front of everyone. 

I traumatized everyone that weekend and I just wanna disappear. I’m afraid to say I wanna d/e because ya know. I feel like I need to apologize to everyone. I’m so ashamed. 

I just tried to be outgoing because it’s something he likes and it’s something I like too, when I’m feeling okay. But I haven’t felt okay in so long.",jcmblunt,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tstj28/i_dont_have_a_title/
How can one keep going when everything is falling apart and you stopped wanting to live years ago,"I 21 male am having to move after two years of not having the best luck. I always get the bad luck I don’t know why but every time literally every time it isn’t over dramatic or anything but literally every time I take 3 steps to betterment something just ruins it I’ve tried change my mind viewing the good things and enjoy the good times but I can’t have that. At 16 is when I snuck out my house went to a park pretty open area no kid play sets, nothing like that just literal grass and trees and I contemplated my life and no one knew but the sad part is when I get about about especially with my family they laugh about it like it’s joke (Hispanic family) they just say don’t think like that but day in day out I think about how it wouldn’t have mattered bc I feel like I haven’t made a contribution to anything.

Really struggling...,"Hi, everyone 👋. 39 year old single bisexual woman looking for friend's and support. Having some family issues and it's really bringing me down. I'm sad, depressed, and very lonely. Anyone out there?",NicoleB0731,10,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tsr499/really_struggling/
I’m done trying,"I'm just so done with trying. Anytime things start to look good, something bad happens and it all goes
to crap, and I start feeling this way. Last year, my parents just got a car for me so that I could work more and do stuff over the summer, like hang out with friends. About this time last year, which was also just a month after getting the car, I got into an accident and totaled it. No one was hurt thankfully, but it destroyed me. All my summer plans were ruined and I started getting into a
depressive state. 

I also transferred to a new college over the summer, and since this happened, I
wasn't able to take the car for the first semester. My parents got another car by the end of the semester, and I was allowed to take it up the next
semester if I got a job by a certain time. At first I was having trouble finding a job, but after spring
break I got one and I start this Monday.

So why do I feel depressed again? Me and my friends at college wanted to get an apartment for next
year to save money. There's a few problems though. First, we have to tell the college that we're living
off campus by next Friday, but they only sent out an email about it this week, so we have practically no
time to get anything set up. My friends don't have jobs yet, which is hurting our chances of getting an
apartment. Me and my one friend are definitely in on this, but two others are still on the fence, and it's
frustrating because the amount of people that go in on this with us will determine which apartment
we can get. 

Another issue is that the school makes it hard for most people who already live on campus
to move off campus because of their stupid policies. 

I’m starting to stress out a lot because I don’t feel like it’s going to be possible to get an apartment. I told my mom about this and she thinks I would be better off trying for next year, but I already got a job here and quit my job back at home. 

On top of all of this, I’ve been feeling really insecure about a lot of things. I don’t feel like my friends care about me sometimes. I’m not doing as good in college as I had hoped. I feel lonely, especially when I’m with my friends and their significant others. I feel insignificant and just worse than everyone around me.

Honestly I don’t really know how to explain it. All I know is that I get caught up in my thoughts and negative self talk. It’s gotten to a point where I’ve considered suicide, but I just can’t bring myself to do it. I just feel like there’s a lot going on, but I don’t know how to explain it.

I’ve been seeing a therapist for a few months now, but I don’t feel like he’s of much help anymore. I was also diagnosed with ADHD, and I feel like that might be the cause of some of my issues.

I’ve opened up to some of my friends about my problems and they’ve been mostly supportive. They’ve also been trying to teach me some techniques to combat my thoughts, but some days it’s just too much to even try. 

Sorry this is just a long winded rant. I don’t even feel like I wrote everything that I wanted to write. I wish I could be more concise and feel like I wrote everything that I needed to. I ended up skipping a class to write this so if that’s any indication of how I’m doing… yeah. 

I don’t really know what to do anymore. I feel like anytime I try to do something good for myself or just something I want to do, it all just falls apart. It’s make me not want to try anymore since it just seems to keep happening.",baw9000,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tt289n/im_done_trying/

For context I am male 23.

 Long story short, for the past 7-8 months I am feeling extremly depressed, to the point I don't feel anything anymore, I don't get any good feelings, I don't laugh anymore, I've been extremly pesimistic and I started to care less about myself or the people around me. It got to the point where I am having piles of  garbage in my room, I don't really care about hygiene.... I used to own a business that was pretty succesfull, had great people skills, I was a good negociator and could gain people trust fast, now.... I dont even feel like I am able to speak anymore.. The business ended because a law was changed, since than I worked a few dead end low paying jobs, that made me feel insecure about myself, I started smoking weed again after quitting for 2 years, I started getting into arguments with my girlfriend... Now I am a project manager since 3 months and it's horible, I had the worst training ever, I also didnt put enough effort into it, and I feel like I don't fucking understand anything at this job, im completly lost, it s remote so I just sit in my messy as room and pretend I am working.  I started to feel extremly bad about myself, it got me to the point of me wanting to end it all... I dont feel like I am the same confident person that I was before.. I feel like I somehow lowered my IQ if that is possible, also my memory is so so fucked up, I can forget something that I saw 10 seconds ago :|.. I used to be social, smart, ambitious, now I cant fucking take a shower.. It kind of all begin when I started reflecting about my life, instead of beeing in the moment.. I started remembering trauma from the past that I think it was not processed and now I feel so closed inside myself... Like there is a barrier between me and thw rest of the world. I am tierd, sleeping dont help, I am sitting in my bed and do nothing most of the time. I feel exhausted after small tasks... I feel like I an retarded, I cant fucking explain. Went to therapy, and I found a horrible person there, it was a hypnoterapist, that was not able to get me in the trance and told me that I am impossible that no one had this issue before, that I am the first and it must be something wrong with me.

I am a 20-year-old male. I live with my Dad, stepmom, and her kids. Currently, working at a grocery store as a cashier, after quitting my previous job at a movie theater. This is my second job ever for context. Since I am old enough and capable I have been paying a portion of the rent and buying myself groceries for the past few months as well. So I feel inclined to keep my job for as long as possible.

I was a very introverted kid with a small group of friends in school and at church. Other than those few people, I was not a sociable person. I kept to myself and tended to just listen to other people's conversations. I was essentially the ""quiet"" kid trope. 8th grade and the first two years of high school were my most sociable years. Thanks to marching band I had a large group of people to hang out with. The point being I was far from the most socially inclined person. Leading to many awkward moments that put me to sleep but still keep me up sometimes.

My friend group had disappeared into nothing by the end of my junior year. After quitting marching band, I realized I had no motivation to improve. In November 2018, my mom was diagnosed with Wegner's. And was close to death. Many dialyze and chemo treatments later, she recovered by around February 2019. In August 2019, my dad filed for divorce and left my mother and me. Long story short, I live with my dad again for the sake of my own mental health. We're all on good terms now though. In October 2019, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I have been medicated since and felt better.

Last week I was put on self-checkout since the person who usually does it is. Was at Disneyland for spring break. Self-checkout is given a chair at the entrance to sit in. No big deal. After two days, I come back to find out Management took the chair. The reason, I was told this by a coworker, we needed to be more aware of the customers in self-checkout. And apparently, the chair was taking that away. I am sure this was because of me. And I would have taken full responsibility for that. But what is confusing is no one came to me outright and said it was a problem. And they could have done that any time. I worked from 3:30 pm to 11:00 pm. And as far as I can tell they are in their office till around 7:00 pm.

The day before I was ""training"" another co-worker because she wanted to work in Customer Service and they need to know how to cashier and use self-checkout for some reason. The whole time I had complained about how boring it was to be in self-checkout. Because there is nothing to do other than push a couple of buttons every few seconds. And watching the elderly try and understand how to use our machines. Regardless I could tell from the chair incident that I had a camera on me and that management was watching me through the cameras. Sometimes I would just stare at a camera and smile to be cheeky.

I just don't understand why people aren't just honest with each other. It feels like so much work nowadays to lie. But I know if I don't I'll face the consequences of that. Has anyone else been feeling this way recently? Or is this just because of the way I have grown up?",No-Insurance-2386,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/tsuk7k/i_feel_like_it_would_be_easier_to_be_honest_with/

I've handled everything on my own, no matter how hard it felt.

But the depression and loneliness never really go away, and I don't know that I am capable of actually being around people anymore.

Very quick question: how do you deal with short relapses that come suddenly?,"I've been mostly fine for the last months. I'm taking vortioxetine for my mood, duloxetine for some chronic pain and trazodone to sleep. Everything is super stable, I don't have many emotions left but that's ok. Having a stable mood to me is more valuable than feeling all of the emotions a regular human being should feel.

I have short periods of a couple of days every once in a while where I'm basically back as I was without medications and it's very annoying since I can hardly get anything done when it happens.

Do you have any suggestions or tricks? I try generally to ignore it and keep going but sometimes it is really annoying.

I'm not sure what to write...,"Honestly, I never really tell my close friends or family how much I actually struggle with my own shit. I grew up with a drug abusive father so naturally, I was usually unable to share my emotions with him. And as a kid, I pushed my mom away. Once they got divorced, he naturally fell into a ""hole"" which made his drug addictions worse. At this point, I can't even talk to my father without him being high or drunk. I guess I lost him at this point, but there's not much I can do anymore that I haven't done for him. 

Now that I'm a freshman in college, I still hide my emotions. It was easy to share these feelings with the love of my life, but every happy story has its ending. It's just sad that you realize after that you will never be able to share your emotions with them as you once did before when you were dating. You both might say you want to stay in contact, but it's never completely the same as before. 

Now, I've had my heart broken three times in my life so far. Some bigger than others. Not trying to make an excuse for my problems, but growing up with a broken heart on top of family problems does a toll on you. I feel sometimes as if I don't want to really live anymore, but at the same time, I never would want to kill myself. It's a weird feeling and only a handful of you might be able to relate, but I'm just tired of constantly living in pain. I'll wake up and skip class because don't want to make the walk all the way over to the classroom's building. I make petty excuses for myself, can't fall asleep until sunrise every night, and feel like I have no one to talk to. 

I suppose that's why I'm writing on here. Not to make a big deal about my own problems, but to maybe spread awareness to those who have similar experiences. **I'm just tired.

Life has gone to complete shit in such a short amount of time," 

Have spent the last 2 weeks shut in my room cause im about ready to give up.

November 1st I lost my job and am still unemployed. December 15th, found out my gf of 2.5 years that has been living with me for 1.5 years cheated on me. I’m not entirely innocent here either, I only know she cheated on me because i invaded her privacy and went through her phone. Only thing i will say in my defense is I have never done anything like that before until she started showing some red flags that started making me very paranoid. I always had complete and utter faith in her. Well of course we break up and we both agree to each other we’re gonna take this time apart to become better for each other. She also insists on continuing to live here knowing i dont have a job and need help with some of the bills to which i agree.

Well christmas night we find out shes pregnant. She claims its mine because she never had sex with anyone else, that she only made out with one guy. Well the pregnancy is completely kicking her ass. I mean she literally could not keep any kind of food down and she would spend hours at a time hunched over the toilet puking up stomach acid. She was pretty much just a zombie. We agree to put our relationship problems on hold while we take care of this current situation. Now, we agreed when we first got together that we are not ready to be parents so if she did get pregnant we would not keep it. So after about a month of me basically being her personal caregiver we finally find a good, affordable abortion clinic. Just wanna add here to please use some type of birth control if you really dont want kids. While I am very grateful to have access to great abortion services, I do not wish that kind of pain and stress on any man or woman.

So after things have settled a bit from the abortion we decide to talk about our relationship again. We both agree to try and have a sexual relationship since we both still have needs we want satisfied. So about a month passes by. Should also mention that even though we broke up we still acted like a normal couple in every way, so at the same time we didnt really feel broken up. Now I recognize that we technically arent together so she can do whatever tf she wants with who she wants. In the beginning of February i sent her a message specifically asking her that if she does plan on seeing/fooling around with other people to please let me know now so i dont waste anymore energy on her and can move on with my life. She asks me to give her a week to think about this and im okay with that. 1 week turns into like 4 weeks of her saying she needs more time to think about it. Well she starts going out more and more with her friends again, which is how she cheated on me the first time.

Last week she admits to me that she made out with another guy when she was out with her friends. This sets me off not because she kissed someone else but because this was the exact thing i talked about in the message and she just completely disregarded my feelings by not being straight with me sooner. Well about a week of me not speaking to her goes by but my anger and jealousy are still very strong. One day while shes in shower my emotions get the better of me and decide to go through her phone again. I find flirty messages to a guy and shes asking him if he can meet up. I confront her, tell her i saw the messages and ask her why she keeps telling me she needs more time when she already made up her mind. I finally build up the courage to tell her i want nothing to do with her anymore and its been about a week since we’ve spoken.

On monday I had an extremely important interview at a really amazing job and found out today i didnt get it. So now im sitting here feeling like a complete failure. I’ve been crying non-stop out of anger towards her for making me hate her because she was my first true love experience and she shit all over it. She always told me that if we ever broke up that she wanted to leave me better than she found me but she did the complete opposite. And now i feel like im the one who has to deal with this emotional trauma and trust issues while shes already moved on to the next dick.

Had my first psychiatrist appointment ever. Was told I don’t have depression,"I (20f) was never really properly diagnosed as a kid. My pediatrician “didn’t like labels” but threw Major depressive disorder and Panic disorder around, and prescribed me Zoloft. Was on it for 6 years until January this year where I had a 5 day long panic attack where I couldn’t function. Came off Zoloft by order of my regular doctor (the withdrawal period was ROUGH) but I finally say an actual psychiatrist. Now I’m not discounting her at all, because she could be right, but the psychiatrist told me her theory is I have undiagnosed ADHD, and that my anxiety and ADHD are throwing off the chemicals in my brain, giving me depressive episodes. She gave me hydroxyzine, which is supposed to ease panic attacks. It was a little disheartening because I have been depressed on and off since age 12, and I wish I could have been given something to help with that specifically. But I’m hopeful. I start taking Adderall tomorrow. Maybe she’s right. Maybe if I get my (finally diagnosed) ADHD under control and do some therapy, I’ll feel ok.

In other news, I had a few crying spells today, told my mom about it and she comforted me. Minutes later I hear my dad yelling loud enough for me to  “AGE DOESNT ASK FOR HELP.

How to not feel guilty for needing to be on anti-depressants?,"I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for about 5 years. Once I was diagnosed I would go on and off anti depressants every few months. They did help. I have been completely off of them for about 2 years now and was doing okay. However, I still have depression and anxiety which is progressively getting worse. I feel like I do everything in my power to keep it away. I mediate, wake up and go to sleep at the same time everyday, force myself to get out of bed, get enough sleep, workout cardio/weights 5 days a week, eat healthy, journal, etc. I force myself to do all of these things in hopes my depressed feelings will even slightly diminish. But I still have depression and anxiety which makes it hard to function most days.

I know I should probably be on medication with the way I am feeling currently. However, my family is very anti-medication. Some are also very religious, and will tell me things like ""maybe if you chanted more or prayed to buddha more you would feel better"". So when they say things like this it does make me question myself, and wonder if I am actually doing enough. I think my family's beliefs on medication have rubbed off on me, because now I have this mindset that I am too good for medication or that I don't REALLY need it despite how severe it is getting. Whenever I go on medication there's a part of me that feels guilty for needing it.

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

*******

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",SQLwitch,251,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cz6nfd/new_wiki_on_how_to_avoid_accidentally_encouraging/

Get upset whenever I see anyone doing better than me.,"I already spend 24/7 battling my suicidal thoughts, but when I see someone who is better than me I feel sick to my stomach, and the suicidal thoughts worsen. If they're beautiful, or if they're smarter, or if they have a loving family, if they aren't dirt poor like me etc I feel extra suicidal. I've managed to avoid a lot of triggers, like social media posts, going out to areas where I know I'll see those people living perfect lives, but there's only so much you can avoid. I can't avoid certain areas all the time, beautiful, talented people are everywhere. Even when I try to distract myself by watching a tv show, I'll see a beautiful actress and feel like crying. Or if I go out into a quieter part of town and see people graduating with their proud family, I'll feel like being sick. Like jumping off a bridge there and then. I have zero self esteem, and to be honest there's nothing to base my self esteem off of, I am exhausted of feeling this way but I know it's unlikely it'll ever change.

"Fuck, man. I feel so lonely, yet everyone is around me.","So, I used to live in the this city. I've grew in a building full of friends (us three) and we talked and talked every day. We grew up and apart during university, but we still were kind of close. 

Two of us were diagnosed with depression (me and another one) and we just couldn't keep up socializing as we did before. At least for me, going out brought me great anxiety and I flunked from **several** social events, before or during them.

Anyway, the pandemic hits and one of our friends starts isolating himself, he moves to another home and starts seeing other people, talking to the rest of us less and less.

Now, the one that stayed, we were very close. We used to talk a lot about ""big brain stuff"", argue pacifically because we didn't see things the same way, but we always called ourselves brothers. During this epidemic he became more and more reclusive, fearing we'd get contamined, so we grew appart and appart.

The months kept advancing and I was so alone at home with my mother, which I and my shrink would classify as a complete narcisist, that I decided I'd move to our family's home in the countryside.

There I'd live alone at my home alone, but live literally next to my aunt and grandfather. She would become the keystone that would help me get my shit together. I found work there for some months, but things got harder where I live and I, who began two universities and had some degrees as a technician under my belt, just couldn't find a job.

It's been like that for 13 months. Lot's of CVs shuffled around this 20k pop town and no answer. The ones around too. I started a woodworking business. I really like woodworking. People simply wouldn't buy the stuff I made. I tried socializing with people, going to the gym... but in the end of the day I just talk to my 50 year old aunt and my cats.

Anyway. I started having episodes of hypersomnia, sleeping sometimes 14 hours a day. For a month. I am already seeing GP and my metabolism is great. I've talked to my shrink and the medication is dialed up correctly. ""The issue is something else"" they say.

With this in mind and knowing that this month is slow in business, I decided to come back for some weeks to my home town, to visit my sister, who was away for several months. I thought here I'd also be able to talk to those old friends again and while seeing her. She and I were very close and still talk frequently online.

Well, now I'm here, for a week. However, I couldn't keep up with any meeting she or my friend that still lives next to me arranged. During the weekdays she is having tests or watching Masterchef and can't talk to me. He is busy working or going out to run. All I want is sit in a table, talk about grievences and victories while we were apart, but I get a feeling this won't happen. 

All I do while I'm here is the need to kill time watching youtube videos or reading Sinatra's biography. At the end of the day I have this sick urge to light a smoke or drink myself until I pass out, but I'm avoiding it because I'd have to listen to my mother saying I'm becoming an alcoholic and missing the entire point of the reason why I want to black out with as much clonazepam and ethanol inside me as I can.

I thought home would make me feel a bit whole, at least for some time, but all I think of is jumping from the tenth floor, hanging myself in the bathroom or chopping some major artery.

The problem is me.,"I am tired and seriously considering to end this meaningless existence as painlessly as possible soon.

Unfortunate from birth, I’ve lived a shitty childhood that’s granted me (27F) with lots of trauma I have no choice but to deal with at present. These traumas are exacerbated because I continue to live with my shitty family (I’m broke af, mentally unstable and useless in many ways). 

I can’t seem to get a job where I am both paid and treated with basic human respect. People are disgusting in general, but those who abuse their authority are on another level. 

I am touch starved but cold and distant at the same time. Never had a romantic partner in my sorry life. My therapist believes it has to do with my trust issues, and it’s adorable she thinks that’s all there is to it. I don’t think I could ever love, or like someone enough to put in the effort, it’s just not in my program. 

I have ice in my veins and I tend to hurt people with my bluntness and my inescapable need for isolation. I hate people. My friends are nice and supportive and honestly I have no idea why they put up with an asshole like me but I do get tired of them often. People exhaust me.

I’ve used studying as a coping mechanism all these years. I’ve read way too many novels and real life is just NOT like what my delusional mind expected. I am now facing disappointment after disappointment. I don’t want this.

My cats and my books have kept me alive this long but they’re not enough anymore. I think I could leave them now. I am ready. Death is too tempting: the comfort of eternal silence; an abyss where I will not think or feel, where I will not exist. 

But I am a coward and against improvisation of any kind and I can’t just jump. I need a plan and I need it to work.

Is 900mg of Trazadone and 60mg of Clonazepan enough to kill me?,"I'm between this thin line of do I want to kill myself or do I want to harm myself ao badly that it'll scream how much I'm hurting inside?
I'm terrible with words and with expressing my emotions and everytime I have my appointments with my pshycologist and my psychiatrist, which are often, I can never find the right words to actually tell them how I'm feeling, to tell them how bad I hurt, how frustrated I am with life, how much I just want to sleep all day so I don't have to deal with my anxiety, my depression, with my obsession surrounding my eating disorder (binge eating at the moment - anorexia when I was a teen), my gender dysphoria, my terrible self esteem that doesn't allow me to go out there and chase what I want, my lack of strenght to fight, my constant anger that I hold inside.
I just get out of the appointments feeling worst than I went in because I KNOW they don't understand me and it's my fault because I'm the one who can't actually explain to them all the shit that is going on. Yesterday I caught myself making a video to my little siblings about our happy moments together and it freaked me out.

"I don't think I can achieve what I wanted to, I just want next now.","Tldr: I told myself id allow for me to kill myself once was older bc I felt I owed it to my past and future selves. an older me might have more answers in his toolkit, and I didn't want to rob him of anything. But now, I'm not so sure. 

I don't hate myself. I like to think I have a good relationship with myself. I converse with myself a lot, and its all positive interactions. I'm very kind to me.

Suicide is something I started considering around 2018. Before covid. It was a joke at first, I was still pretty confident in my ability to do anything, and even though I knew I could kms, It wasn't something I thought id have to do. It did however make it easier for me to commit to doing things, after all nothing really matters too much if I'm willing to die should things go sideways. 

But Sometimes, The amount of work I feel like I need to get done, is just too much. Im afraid that to get to where I thought I'd be, and to provide for those whom I wanted to provide, is going to cost too much. I'm young, and I don't want to spend my entire youth slaving away for a goal that can't be attained within the timeframe I want. 

For that reason I gave myself until 30. Bc I thought, and still do sometimes that all it takes is a year to turn things around. At least for me. I used to see it. But it hasn't happened yet. And the vision is fading. 

The concerning part is, I'm crying a lot now. Suicide, as an option for myself is something Ive always taken seriously, but its something that's never had an emotional toll on me until now. I was always very indifferent about life so long as I didn't die a miserable death, or lived a miserable life. Which brings us to the current problem.

So here is what I was thinking. Its Been a few years since I made that promise. and not much has changed. I think I should just go now. The way things are going, I'd be killing myself anyways. And if that's the case why am I waiting. 

I gave myself until 30 bc I thought I'd spend my 20s creeping towards my goals, but I haven't made any progress at all. And I don't have the energy or desire to give this world anything. I'm not sad, just disillusioned.

Maybe I just wasn't made for this world. I'm too lazy, too stubborn, and too self conscious. Too stupid even. I put too much thought on all the things I didn't want to do, but felt I had to do. Making myself a slave in the future I saw. I don't know where it all went wrong. But at some point I just didn't want to try anymore.

That my stomach would turn and my hair would fly around and the wind would whistle in my ears.

I don’t see what the point in being here is. I was thinking…I’m 18, and already feel like shit. So why should I have to suffer my whole life? Why not just take the easy way out early on my own accord. No family will miss me. No friends will miss me.

My 5 year old has been hospitalized many times and under the care of a psychiatrist since he was 2
He has ziptied his sisters neck.
He has stabbed me. 
He jumps in front of cars to try to kill him self.
 I was prescribed a medication (brand name reglan) while pregnant with him that was originally created as an antipsychotic, turned prescribed to patients going thru chemotherapy  for nausea, the medication was pulled from the market for causing neurological issues in children when given in the first trimester. I was given it in my third trimester as a life saving measure after i lost 55lb , had my gallbladder removed and a feeding tube put into my stomach and was throwing up over 200 times per day and hospitalized for 2 months.
It caused him to have major issues mentally
And neurologically that keep getting worse. 
Today he ate laundry detergant 
Other days he breaks everything he sees
I used to have a beautiful home with beautiful things… im not a person anymore
Im a slave and he has no off switch.
There are no calm sweet moments or peace
The only time there is peace is when he is asleep… think like the most severe case of aggressive adhd that exists..
I cant keep living like this.
I stay awake for 60 hours at a time because if i sleep he will hurt his sister or himself.
No school will take him. 
I am all alone. Besides his sister (6) who is just as terrorized as i am. 
All of my family wont be around because of him
All my friends wont be around because of him
Everything i do or accomplish is always undone by him… nothing will ever matter or make a difference 

I want a do over at life… i want a time machine. 
I want an out. I want an exit door… i just want an option and to not be forced to live this way anymore. This is a curse. This is hell. This is no way to live. Every single thing and moment revloves around this nightmare and nothing ever gets any better… it only gets harder and worse. 
No one understands. 
i hope someone here understands

Im so tired of yelling
Im just so tired.

I feel like I am responsible for my brother death and wish it was I who should have died,"Few months ago my brother died.  It was a tragic accident . He was so young ,not even 6.  Dogs killed him and I feel like I am responsible for his death even though everyone says I'm not. 
He left to play that day and I usually stop him when he goes alone
. I often tell him to wait for his friends or do his homework but he was so stubborn he didn't use to listen easily . Still , it stopped him from going outside alone many times. 
Since last few days before his death I didn't talk with him a lot often ignored him because I had exams and didn't have time to play.
So on  that unfortunate day, I was studying and didn't notice him going alone again.  My father told him to go where my cousin is ( which was like 20 - 30 steps away from my house) he didn't listen to him and went straight to the playground to play with his friends where he was attacked by dogs and died due to his injuries and infection.
I feel like I should have stopped him that day from going alone. As a sister I failed him
As a person I failed him
I could have spend more time with him, could have loved him more, could have done 100s of things but I didn't 
I saw him on icu bed. A boy full of life and joy suddenly is so quiet.  He was my cousin in relation but I consider him my brother because he had spend years with us and we had that sibling connection
. His body was looking so lifeless, so pale , full of bite marks and scratches. 
When he died , I couldn't cry because I had no time to.
My family was falling apart and I had to support them during these times.  I tried my best to do whatever I could.  Put up a strong girl act ever since he was in hospital. 
Gave everyone support. Protected my family from evil words of society ( which honestly is so disgusting and distasteful I cant even say).
I saw his body burn infact I was the one who had to burn it because his sis couldn't do it alone.
At that moment,  I couldn't stop my tears
Even after all this, my family thinks I don't miss him or that I'm not affected by his death.
They scold me for being continuously on phone( which I do to distract my mind from ' what if' thoughts)
They think I'm ambition less and doesn't care about my family,  doesn't care about him 
After all this...hearing those words is honestly heartbreaking 
I did everything for them and this is how they think of me
I feel like I should have died instead of him.

I wish I could just be unconscious forever,"The worst part about sleep is waking up. The thought that I was just fully unconscious for a couple hours and now I’m being forced to exist fucking sucks. 

Everyday it gets harder to get out of bed, regardless of the medicine. 

At least now I finally have an exit path. I tried to drown myself before but that didn’t work. Every other accessible method would leave me dead at my family’s house (at home cause of college stuff) which I don’t want to do because I’ve already been enough of a burden to them. 

My goal is to get a summer internship, move into an apartment, and off myself within the first month of being there. Hopeful thinking but I’m sure I can do it. 

In the meantime I’ve been trying to cope without my blades. Literally everything else pales in comparison to the relief that cutting gave me. Why is it that people are allowed to harm themselves with alcohol or cigarettes or overeating, but the minute someone cuts themself it’s so bad. Cutting won’t even kill you whereas the things I mentioned are actively killing you. It’s just fucking stupid.  It feels like everyone is standing on a soapbox reprimanding me for trying to cope when they don’t even understand how hard it is to simply live. 

I just want to die. It’s fucked up that I don’t have the right to dictate if I live or not. People have to resort to dangerous methods that may leave them injured and unable to die simply because assisted suicide isn’t readily available.

"Even as a child, I wish I never fucking existed.","I wouldn't say I had a terrible childhood but definitely not the best. I was very much spoiled so atleast that makes up for something. I'm going to express the bad on this post though, I saw my father get arrested. My dad was also an acholic which was got him arrested, He didn't get charged with anything serious but I saw him in a cop car and handcuffs at 11. They forced me out of the house so they could search it as well. That's probably the worse thing though. Now onto the smaller stuff, my mom yelled at me for speaking. It was a gamble wether I would get told to shut up or an actual conversation, most of the time being told to shut up. This made me genuinely hate myself, the fact my dad seemed like he cared more about alcohol than his family.( I'd like to say he was never physically abusive and I don't know what I've mentioned counts as abusive but it definitely messes someone up.) Back to my mom, her expectations made me a high achiever in academics but it becomes overwhelming after awhile as any ""gifted"" kid would know. She made me think about HBCU'S in middle school. I have a very specific memory of being yelled at for getting at 60% in math and her saying "" you've done good all these years and know you mess up?!"".

"Got plans, would like to talk about them","I'm so far gone and I don't want to get back. What's even left? I don't know, I haven't found myself in a long time. I can't ever remember the last time I actually wanted to live and prosper. Thrive. What the hell does that even mean?

I have a planned trip tomorrow. I'll be heading to a different city other than my own and plan A is to not come back. My reason being that I really, really don't want to die in my hometown. I was born and raised here and I've never left. Not wanting to die here has nothing to do with not wanting to stain this place or giving it bad memories for the people I'm leaving behind. It's just that I really really don't like this city. It's changed so much over the past ten years and I don't feel at home anymore.

What even is home? I haven't referred to my apartment as a home in months. Ever since I started feeling a mean presence surrounding me. That's when I began sleeping underneath the kitchen table, on a mattress. Just to be able to shut the door leading to the hallway. I could feel as if someone was standing there, watching me while sleeping. I felt safer under the table, behind blankets and a shut door. This isn't my home anymore.

I've had a shitty day and it's not even 1 pm here. I was supposed to meet up with a friend and go for a walk but she forgot. Her new boyfriend is getting all of the love and care and I get it. I really get it. I'm saying this in a very authentic, non-sarcastic tone - It must be wonderful! I'm sure you guys have lots of fun and a lot of great conversations. Learning stuff about each other etc. I'm happy for you. :) I just wish you wouldn't forget about me. Not even a month ago you cried on the phone out of worry for me. Today everything is just fine and dandy? I'm sorry but you've lost me.

It's fine, I'm not going to kill myself because of her. My trip has been planned for at least two weeks. I've been looking forward to going, hopefully having the balls big enough this time around to actually go ahead and jump off that bridge I've already been visiting once. Heck, I've even custom made a rope ladder to get over the anti-suicide barrier. I'm crafty! And I'm very, very sad, lonely, tired and completely at the end of my rope. (Apart from the ladder, hehe)

Sorry for this mess. I'm messy. I would like to talk to someone who doesn't know me. Talk about my plan for tomorrow, in detail, without having to worry about police showing up. Because even though I hope to be able to go through with my plan, I still want to tell people for some reason. Obviously I can't tell the people in my life or they'll do everything in their power to stop me. But who knows, maybe it'll be helpful to talk about everything and to be brutally honest? Maybe it'll change my mind?

Thank you.

I love her so much and she loves me so much and it makes me so sad that she is not willing to try to fix it together with me. I have had already plenty of nightmares with her and I just wake up hoping that everything was a dream and in reality I will still be able to spoon with her, but after a few seconds my brain activates and it lets me know that reality is real, and that I will not feel her hugs again, or the feeling of my fingers touching her face... On top of that, I had a really fucked up trauma a few years ago which gets triggered once in a while and it transmits a lot of anxiety. When I woke up this morning I felt a deep void in my stomach, everything was sadness and then a lot of anxiety kicked in, and I fckng hate it, this anxiety reminds me so much of the one I got from my trauma and it is just terrible.

I have moments where I want to end it all, just thinking that I'll have to continue with  my life, continue working, continue with the routine, and everything without a single clue of what she might be doing or thinking just eats me up.

The most bizarre morning.,"Throwaway acc to share my morning. 

I’m 25 and have had suicidal thoughts since I’d say roughly 2012 which is the year I graduated school .. Anyhow, my life has taken a turn for the worst these past two years (I was working in hospice care and studying medicine till my mental health deteriorated) to say the least! I was made homeless on April 18th 2020 and have since been ‘couch surfing’ which honestly has been the most challenging thing I thought I’d never have to deal with. I spent Christmas crashing at a friends place as I had no family or place of my own to stay at and despite the fact that my Xmas day was spent sitting alone all day eating bread and butter (don’t mean to sound ever so sorry for myself but I’ve honestly tried to be so positive through the shittiest times) i powered on through, trying to focus on what was to come. 

Anyway,  NYE came around and he offered to take me out and at first I was reluctant because I hate receiving anything or feeling like a charity case but he insisted and I could use an alcoholic beverage so I went along. We had a great night and he told me again and again how I’m so welcome to stay with him till I’m on my feet and how he honestly doesn’t mind etc etc… fast forward to the morning after January 1st, he was waking me up telling me I had to leave. He couldn’t keep me any longer… I’m thinking he wanted to tell me while drunk but didn’t have the heart? That’s fine anyway. 

So… I pack all my belongings in to my car and wonder what the hell im going to do with myself. No suicidal thoughts at that moment. Just sort of numb. Those of you whom have been there will know. Just completely numb. Face vibrating/hyper aware… numb. Does that make sense?
So fast forward to present day.. I since lost my job because I moved around so much I couldn’t commit to work and also in turn had my vehicle seized and then crushed because I couldn’t afford to tax it or collect it from the impound. This is legit my reality. 

Anywhooo….. I’m staying at a homeless shelter (all my belongings other than two bag fulls of clothing and one backpack with my toothbrush, toothpaste, soap and shoes have been sold to get me by), as I wake up this morning I am painfully aware of how much of a beautiful morning it is outside. The sky is blue, the birds are chirping and there isn’t a vehicle or person in sight. Everything is untouched. The mist is rising from the ground as the sun climbs to a higher position in the morning sky and I just feel an overwhelming sense of peace. Then I remember my exit plan. There is a little area of forestry by a beautiful lake in my hometown which I have always told myself (since attempt no.1) that this spot is where I will cross from this world into the next, as the sun climbs into the sky and every time I’ve pictured the scene, it always looks identical to this morning in my minds eye. I get dressed and realise that I do not have rope and I also know that there is none in the shelter, at least none that would be of any use to myself. I settle for my belt. So I get washed and I dress myself in my favourite outfit, plus two jackets to keep the chilly morning air at bay and I head out toward the lake. As I’m heading across town I don’t see a single person, one or two buses and a handful of cars but still it is all so peaceful, almost like the path is cleared for me to get to my destination, like someone is saying “it’s a good time now, you can come”… it sounds crazy I know but it felt so OK in my spirit like it was meant to be. I get to the small patch in the forest next to the lake and I see the tree, the one I see in my minds eye, looking just like it did the last time I saw it in person. Everything is so peaceful. I’m aware that I cannot hang, I must use my belt. Ok, I’m ok with this. I go towards the tree and I stand there next to it. The most bizarre feeling of rushing energy beneath my feet, like intense pins and needles just came from nowhere and then, having just crossed the entire town without seeing a single soul on the streets a group… I mean the BIGGEST group of people (men, women and children) all came walking past on the little mud-trail next to the trees where I stood. Nobody paid me much attention. But they came. When they had passed (it seemed like it took them all forever to get out of the wooded path toward the lake) the rushing beneath my feet stopped and I suddenly had the most god awful toothache. Toothache (I still feel now) so bad that there was no way I could die in ‘peace’ because it was/is so intense. I returned to my bunk and have spent the day processing the morning. I’m painfully aware of the time 9:37AM too… is this the time I’m supposed to have passed? I don’t know. I’m not feeling in a state of depression at present, just very tired. 

TL;DR: woke this morning and felt like it was my time to ‘leave’.. headed to my spot without seeing a single person. Got to my spot and was interrupted by a huge group of hikers… surreal experience. Not sure if I’m just going crazy.",THR_AWYY,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tv93z0/the_most_bizarre_morning/

"Want to kill myself, now I can't because my fiance says he will too","I guess my fiance and I are a good match, we have both struggled with depression and mental health problems for a long time, and we are both sort of co-dependent on each other, needing each other to make us feel less depressed.

A few months ago I had an injury. Based on 2 doctors opinions it seemed to be something mild that would get better eventually, so even though I was in pain, I was able to mostly ignore it. When months went by and it didn't get better, the specialist that I was seeing sent me for another test. This showed it was a little more serious issue than initially thought. But I asked him what my prognosis was, and he said that it ""could"" get better with time and physical therapy.

So, more months went by with no improvement. I'm scared to google the condition, because if I hear something bad I'm going to freak out. But from things I've heard from other people, and a few things I've happened across online, this can be something that doesn't go away. I got my specialist to refer me to someone else to be evaluated for possible surgery. But I don't know what I'm going to do if it turns out I can't afford the surgery or if insurance won't cover it (the injury happened at work so my doctor visits so far have been paid for by worker's comp). This appointment isn't until May. In the meantime, I've made an appointment with a local office that specializes in pain treatment, although the website says that they are usually not covered by insurance, but they offer free consultations. I'm seeing them next week.

I was tolerating the pain up until now, as long as I was telling myself that it would only be temporary. But now that I think it might never go away, I'm a mess. I talk on the phone with my fiance every night (we live a few hours apart, and I'm planning to move to his town when I get a job lined up), and the last few nights I have been crying most of the time. He is a wonderful person and has been doing his best to cheer me up. I was upset about the fact that due to pain and limited mobility, my apartment has been a mess for a few months, and I feel bad about not being able to walk my dog or play with my cat as much as usual. He said that when we live together, he will take care of everything. He said he'll do all the cleaning and walk my dog and play with my cat. He said that he will take care of me and I won't have to do anything that makes my pain worse.

But I don't want to spend the rest of my life bedridden or in pain. Last week we were talking on the phone and it was close to bedtime. He said he was nervous to hang up, because he was afraid of what I would do when the phone call ended. I assume he meant he was afraid I would try to kill myself.

A few days ago I told him that he shouldn't have to be tied down with someone messed up like me, and he'd be better off with someone else. He thought I was trying to break up with him.

I started thinking about tying up loose ends, like how to make sure my pets are taken care of, and to make sure my fiance is okay financially, as he is going through a rough time with finances. I realized I have money in a few different retirement funds (from different jobs) and life insurance, so I listed his name as the beneficiary of all of them, and sent him all the info. I said that this was so he would be taken care of ""if something happens to me.""

Then when we talked on the phone, he said ""If something happens to you, I don't want to be around."" I told him that it bothered me to hear him say that, and he got a little annoyed and said ""Why? You'd be gone so you won't know what's happening to me afterward anyway."" I said, ""You were ok without me before we met, you can be ok afterward."" He told me that before we met, he was in very bad shape. He was divorced and had been rejected by some other women he was interested in, and felt that nobody would ever love him and there was no point in living. He said that when we got together it was the first time in years that he felt happy.

So now I feel like I can't kill myself because then he'd do the same thing. I know it sounds hypocritical to be ok with killing myself but not ok with him killing himself. The difference is that he wouldn't be the cause of my suicide. My suicide is due to a medical problem that is not likely to get better, and I don't want to spend the next few decades in physical pain. But now I feel like I have to stay alive just so that he does too. Sometimes I wish we had never met because I'm sure he'd be better off without me.",codependentfiance,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tv928y/want_to_kill_myself_now_i_cant_because_my_fiance/

A guy walking his dog asked if I was okay probably because I had makeup running all down my face so I just laughed gave a thumbs up and walked away it freaked me out.

How to help someone from another country planning on committing suicide?,"Hey, my friend's (from UK) ex-girlfriend (from the Netherlands) supposedly tried committing suicide and ended up in a hospital, from what we know she's planning on attempting it yet again when they release her. They are both above 18 years old, she's always been suicidal and their breakup a few months ago has messed with her a lot.   


My friend would like to ask what can be done if he's from another country to make sure she gets the help she needs (obviously outside of him trying to talk to her, he's already on it). He's been wondering if a wellness check or anything alike was possible.

Things have NEVER been this bad,"I struggled with mental illness as a child (anxiety and selective mutism) and through the years my mental health just got worse and worse. I started suffering from depression at 13 years old and started self harming. I then experienced multiple traumas, and the stress of them and everything that happened afterward, lead to the onset of schizoaffective disorder (depressive type). I have experienced more traumas since, including a recent trauma where I started therapy with a psychologist and I put my full trust in her, and 2 years later I find out that she has been manipulating, gaslighting, and outright mentally &amp; emotionally abusing me the whole time. R***, SA, mental &amp; emotional abuse, it never fucking stops. 

Throughout all of this up until around 8 months ago, I still had some happy moments and could laugh and had passion for things and so much love in my heart, but fuck, when I tell you all of that is gone, I mean it. I don’t want anything other than to carry out and complete my suicide. I love my family and friends and animals SO fucking much and I fucking hate that my suicide will cause them so much pain. I don’t want to hurt anyone. This pain is just so unbearable 😥 I don’t want a job, to study, to volunteer, to have friends or a romantic relationship, I don’t want to do anything except disintegrate into the sheets of my filthy bed and not exist anymore. I can’t get hurt again I can’t I can’t I can’t. Don’t get me wrong though, I do still logically know that I love the people and animals in my life and logically know the things that I care about, I just don’t feel it. It’s like there’s a black hole in my stomach enveloping all emotions other than depression &amp; anxiety / panic, and there’s nothing I can do. 

I don’t belong here. This life isn’t meant for me. I’m so, so tired, and I’m SO fucking scared of being hurt again. I wouldn’t survive it, and every day I’m alive I’m more likely to get hurt again.

TW: SA I can’t do this shit.,"I’m feeling like this because of the post I made earlier today about how my sisters boyfriend was assaulting me for weeks. 

I told my sister today and went to the hospital and got a SA kit and the police are now involved. 

But I still can’t stop thinking about how her boyfriend threatened me with a gun and just did that to me…

I’ve been through assault like this when I was younger and I’m feeling the same way how I did when it first happened, if that makes sense. 

I wanna kill myself so fucking bad right now. I’ve been crying, yelling, punching things, etc. 

I’ve tried to tell my girlfriend about what happened today but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Instead we just got into an argument because she thought I didn’t wanna talk to her. 

I don’t wanna tell her because she’s been assaulted 3 times and I don’t wanna remind her of those.

"oh, I'm back","This never seems like exactly the right place to get these thoughts out of my head, but I guess it doesn't matter very much.

 I'm struggling a lot with this pile of garbage again, and I'm still not sure where to go with fixing anything. A friend reached out tonight and it just about wrecked me. Part of me is so desperate for that, but too many things keep me back from taking it, and I'm not entirely sure that's a bad thing. Wanting it doesn't mean it's right. The last thing I want is to be any more of a burden on anyone else, and how exactly is trauma dumping not being a burden to your friends?

Trick question. It is. Everything that doesn't make people laugh or feel better is a burden when it's coming from me. This isn't something that's worth losing friends over. I opened up and broke down to someone when I couldn't take it anymore, and they outright said that I was hard to be around when I was ""acting like this"". I've tried reaching out to hotlines, but they always leave me feeling worse than I did before texting; if I'm not actively planning to kill myself, then everything is fine. You don't have it bad enough.

Jesus Christ, I know that. I know how fortunate I am, and that knowledge is a knot in my throat when I'm sitting outside in below freezing weather, crying to the point where I feel like throwing up. 

I don't want to be alone. Who am I supposed to rely on? The amount of times I've gone to my husband and felt dismissed, or not taken seriously, has shown me that he isn't an option. My mom has never really been capable of emotionally supporting me; it was always the other way around. 
Am I supposed to get a therapist? Me and what mental health insurance? I'm already dumping money into my physical health; I can force myself to function, but I can't do anything to stop my teeth from breaking. 
Not only that, but the last therapist I went to (as a child) told me that my actions/attitude/emotions would see me ending up just as bad as the person who repeatedly raped and assaulted my mother. Who threatened, more than once, to kill me once he knew I'd seen him. I can't lose friends over this, and besides that - I'm not their fucking responsibility. Why the fuck would anyone want to hear about that?

Why the fuck would I want them to know that about me? That was such a significant reason why I didn't tell my mom when my ex started raping me. The other reason is that I fell into the trap of not knowing what to call it, and I still don't… Sometimes I still don't know if I'm right. I fight with myself about that so often it makes me nauseous. I don't know what it is. I don't know why I'm letting myself be such emotional garbage. Fucking trash human who can't keep themself together enough to just be a normal friend.

Everything is compacted into my chest and it hurts. It all hurts. I'm lonely and I ache, but I don't want anyone to know that I'm this fucking pathetic. I can't push back this breakdown and I don't want it to become more than that. I want help so desperately and there's nowhere to get it. Why am I such a fucking garbage human being? 

What if I'm not actually a good mom? I don't want to think about my child growing up to write shit like this because I was so… I need to be better, damn it. Why does my stupid fucked up brain keep saying that I should just fix it by not being anyone's burden. 

I'm not okay. I haven't been okay and I don't know how to be. I want to do so many things and that's why I'm sitting here - writing instead of doing some of them. But I don't think I can keep from doing all of them.
My ex beat the shit out of me once and I feel like all I deserve is to have the shit kicked out of me again and again. I hate the person I am.

Split decision,"I think of killing myself every night. I am haunted by the sudden breakup I experienced and I hate myself for letting it happen. I know the pain wont last forever. This shall all pass. But death seems so enticing. An easy way out.

I know that after a breakup I’m supposed to work on myself. To grieve and feel all the emotions. To rise to new heights. But it just feels like too much. I have no energy left to live on this stupid earth. I have no motivation to fix myself.

I am a deeply flawed person. My ex pointed out all the sudden bursts of anger or uncontrolled anxiety. I did my best to grow as a person but got so lost in being better for her that I completely forgot how to be better for myself. And so I lost myself.

The reality is that anxiety controls every day of my life. Every social interaction. Every trauma. I don’t know how to fix it and I’ve tried for so long. I feel like an utter failure.

I don’t want to die but I also don’t want to live, atleast in this current life.

I feel like I've been subconsciously preparing for an opportunity to end things.,"(25M) I've been a depressed little shit for as long as I could remember, but ever since my mom killed herself 7 years ago, I've been struggling on and off.

Never have been very social, then that happened and I hardly even talk to my family anymore. I moved back in with them a couple years ago, and though there are some other circumstances, I hardly interact with them.

I've been thinking and came to the conclusion that if I managed to sever ties with all my friends and family, that I could accept going through with it. I don't want to hurt my brother or my aunts who raised me. I know how it feels first-hand, and I could never do that to someone without feeling guilty. Hence why in my head, if they wouldn't know about it, I think I'd convince myself to go through with it. I had made a plan for it at work before just so they wouldn't be the ones to see it.

Life feels like it’s crashing around and I’m a balloon in the wind,"I need help. I know that, and I am finally at a place where I can admit that and am trying to seek it. 

I recently got broken up with by the love of my life because of reasons that I did. I was mean to him, I yelled, I have such severe mood swings that I would yell and cry over the dishes in the sink not being done or the laundry not folded. He finally decided he was done and gave me all of my stuff back. Problem is that we have the same friend group, same extra activities and overall enmeshed our lives together completely. We talked about marriage and kids and I finally thought I had everything in my life I had prayed about for years and it all came tumbling down. 

I started therapy and the root of the issue is that my parents are both narcissists and when I met the bf my parents didn’t talk to me, but over time I stared  letting them back into my life which caused so much stress that I took it out on the bf. The therapy has helped me see that I don’t want to be like them and I can’t act this way to others. I also started cutting which I never did before. I saw my doctor and got put on anti depression pills and anxiety meds. Right now my body feels a little like lead and while I don’t want to continue cutting I can’t get the thought of wanting to kill myself out of my head.

I will be taking my life tonight,"BP1 guy here. I have exhausted every available resource to try &amp; get relief (that includes asking god for help). I have seen a psychiatrist every 2 months since I was 21 years old. I have taken every mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, antidepressant &amp; anxiety medication known to man (and of course taken to the face the nasty side effects that come with taking them).

I have had the police called on me in nov. for having a firearm to my head after getting very bad news (they wouldn't enter my apartment because I had a weapon &amp; take medication) So the crisis unit was dispatched to me instead, Little to no relief. I have called the crisis line many times with absolute 0 benefit, pretty much all they can do is ask if you are going to hurt yourself &amp; if you say ""yes"", they will send police.

 My most recent conversation with them was terrible. I said ""Before we begin our conversation, I want to preface that I know you have a job to do but I cannot have the police here because that would end very badly. I just need someone to talk to &amp; resources, I divulge information like a manic pez dispenser &amp; my life is arbitrary."" She replied with ""I am going to transfer you to a warm line so you can have a more long winded conversation and get some help"" Another gentleman picked up the phone &amp; said ""I have reviewed your notes with my collogues &amp; you are 26 and have a lot to be thankful for, you have just called our line, spewed a bunch of crap &amp; obviously have a higher education or do a lot of reading because you are using vocabulary my colleagues don't understand, you have wasted our time &amp; we need to speak with people who actually need help"" then hung up.

I don't abuse drugs or alcohol but I am prescribed the highest dose of several anxiety medications &amp; a well known sleeping sedative. I normally don't take all that I need so I have hundreds of extra pills that I plan to mix with a couple drinks to hopefully fall asleep &amp; was recently prescribed a medication to prevent vomiting.

Life is a bit too unfair,"I can’t take this. I try to make friends but they keep doing that stupid thing where they pretend to be friendly with me and then make fun of me behind their backs. Today they literally told me I can come with them to dinner and that they’ll tell me what time to be there. They never told me and they wen there anyway. When I asked them why they left me behind, I got left on delivered. I hate this. They do it to everyone they feel is “weird”. I’m not that weird at all. I’m respectful and helpful and normal, even if I’m a bit shy and socially anxious. I have no friends now, everyone is being fake with me.

I'm sorry I'm not good,"I'm sorry I'm not musical like the rest of the family. I'm sorry I'm not a mechanic like the rest of the family, I'm sorry I didn't have as many friends as my siblings growing up, I know that always was a shortcoming and I never got over it.

I'll never be right or good enough, I'll always be bad. I'm a sickness, a cancer, a mold, a plague. I make things worse and worse, I get that now. I wish I could be better but I really don't know what to do, how to change. I'm not sure what it is about me that infects and rots away anything good I touch.

I keep away now, you say you want me to visit and I wish I could, I miss my family, but I'm not good for anyone, I make things go bad, I always have. I know you blame me for your addiction, and maybe you're right to, I should have been less bratty, I should have been a better son.

I won't do the irrevocable, I know that's hurt you even worse, I can't say I understand why, you'd be better off after the pain subsided, like a bitter pill.

I wish I could be who you all deserve, I wish I could live up to every hope you had for me. But I never could, I'm just not... I'm just not good, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

There are people in this world who are parasites, evil and wicked, harming others for fun, I'm not one of them, I'm more insidious, because even with the best intentions I bring naught but ruin and decay.

Tried to hang myself yesterday and failed. But got a hopeful message from a friend today..,"I was alone yesterday and going out of my mind. I felt so lonely even though so many people say they’re there for me. My brain doesn’t let me enjoy anything anymore and I can’t take it. I wish I could be someone else who loves to live.

I put a rope up in my closet and tried hanging myself. I passed out briefly but then the knot gave way and I fell to the ground. I could see but couldn’t move for a minute or so. It was kind of euphoric if I’m being honest. I used to be scared of death, but I’m starting to accept it. I’m sorry if that puts anyone off. I wish I could be different.

I skipped a party last night because of my illness—I felt like alienating myself. I told my friend, a guy I’ve been casually hooking up with, that I skipped because I’d been “dealing with some mental health stuff”. This was his response:

“Yeah… I’ve had and have my fair share of spiraling and mental roadblocks for as long as I can remember. 
Life can be a struggle but i like to think of my soul/life force like a little fire 🔥 inside me. Sometimes it’s as small as a candle flame and other times a bonfire. 
I know that fluctuations are natural and inevitable but, when the fire starts to die down,  I try to slow down and focus on giving care and compassion to build it up. I know that immediate changes aren’t possible and only through slow buildup and continual fuel added, can we make something bigger and brighter. 
Idk if that made much sense, but I read about that a while ago and it’s stuck with me ever since.”

I’ve had to tell a few friends about my problems after being antisocial, and I’ve never had their responses make me genuinely hopeful, which is what this did. I’m feeling better than I did because of it.

"a new expression I hate ""it's ok to not be ok""","No, it's really not ok to be at risk. The one objective in life is to not die, so why is it fine to be in an insufferable amount of pain that you would want to end your life. It's not ok to be so broke you can't afford bills or food. It's not ok to be starving all the time, it's not ok to have not have any meaningful social interaction. None of this is fine, it's provably bad for your mental and physical health. I feel like there's some insensitive people behind the curtain pulling the strings on mental health talk to get expressions like this to be adopted.

I feel as if I'm going nowhere in life,"Hi, I'll try to make this post short. So my whole life I (F19) never really thought I'd get older or graduate high school. When I was in 6th grade I thought I'd be dead by 8th grade but then high school came along and I kind of winged it and ended up graduating. I pretty much missed out a lot in high school, I didn't go to parties I dated 2 guys and never tried again because I just felt as if I'm a boring person and I'd bore the other person with me... anyway I thought once I graduated I'd probably finally get happy and do all the things I ever wanted to do with friends. Well... things have gotten worse since I graduated and honestly wish that I could go back in time, things are much much much more complicated and my mental health has been way worse than it had been my whole life up until graduation. I am now going to community college and well haven't really accomplished anything and haven't had that ""fun"" I've always wanted. I tried to go out and have fun with my way way more outgoing friends but my parents even at 18 then wouldn't let me because ""they'll corrupt you and get you to leave us and get you to quit school"" even though my friends are also going to community college or university... They go out and are living their 20s now and don't bother to ask me anymore. Not that I'd blame them... My mother recently is also going through a psychotic break and my dad needs me home to look after her and also focus on school. i'm turning 20 in August and I feel as if my days are a loop of watching over my mom and school and work. I feel no separation between days and everything is blurring together. I feel as if I am wasting away and will never get to experience anything in my damn life let alone try dating anyone. My mom doesn't want to get any sort of help she'll get mad and storm out of the house. I have been trying to make my brother have a good time lately, I have been taking him to the movies he at least deserves to have some fun as a sophomore in high school and stuff but I'm just not living myself. I don't really see myself living past 25 I have always said that since 6th grade. So far I don't really have a reason to stay. I've hated my life my whole life so far. I have been crying myself to sleep for the past week. I can't even stand to look at posts my friends make of living their lives. I feel so trapped and things are never going to change for me. I can't exactly move out because my parents have made me so dependent on them my whole life by never letting me do anything and if I talk about moving out they start saying stuff like "" were we not good parents to you?, you're so ungrateful, We will take the car, If you move out don't even bother showing your face here again, etc.."" I feel as if I'm living on autopilot... I going to wither away forgotten. I hate myself so much, I can't even focus in my classes anymore. I just want to drop my classes for semester and try again this fall...Yes, I've gone to a therapist, I have been going since 2021.

I have the noose ready,"I've attempted before so I know how to tie them, it was just a matter of making it when I had enough energy so it's there when I need it. I'm gonna stick around for a while because I'm not feeling as viscerally low as I have the past while, but I'm sure those feelings will return tonight when I'm totally alone and when they do I'll be ready. I'm sorry to everyone who's tried to help me on here - I feel like I'm failing you all and it's not a reflection upon your kindness or generosity. I've known this is how I'll go for years now, I just didn't know when. Now I think I do. 

I wish it didn't have to be this way and that I'd done so many things differently, that I'd allowed myself all the happiness I've tasted in my imagination. But hell, I've had a pretty good run of it. I've loved people, reciprocally and one-sidedly, as friends, family, partners. I've seen Mt. Everest and the Taj Mahal. I've left a hot, stuffy, smoky party and stepped out into the cold streets of Minnesota; my breath spiralled upward like steam and fresh snow squeaked beneath my boots; bliss. I've sung along to my favorite song live. I've had the thrill of locking eyes with someone in a dark, crowded room, and the satisfaction of kissing them later. I have felt, fleetingly and with incomparable relish, gender euphoria; in makeup, dresses, under the gaze who those who love me, I have for a minute or an hour or a night felt like myself, at last, at last. I've been hungover and then had a really, really good Cuban sandwich.

This all sounds like bragging, and I guess it is. I've *lived*. A lot of it has been tremendously hard, but some of it has been so relentlessly sweet I almost can't stand it. I'm glad I can die being able to say that with honesty. It feels like enough for me. Soon, it will be time to let go.

My name is Sam, I'm almost 25 years old, and I think that in another version of my life, I would've had a lot to give people. Not the world, just those around me. If you're reading this, please, for me: let yourself be the version of yourself that has the most to offer. It's not always the easiest version to be, but it's the most rewarding, and the kind that keeps you from tying nooses and hiding them under your bed until everyone's gone to sleep. It would mean a tremendous amount to me if only one person carried out this directive. If you do so, I love you very much. If you don't, I love you anyway, and I understand; I was the same way.

How to avoid media coverage?,Sometimes I see news stories of people who commit suicide with carbon monoxide. Is it possible to die without the media coverage?

I think I’m ready to die and I’m at ease with that,"I(20f) think I’m ready to do it.

Bit of a back story… I was diagnosed with BPD after being raped whilst serving in the military though I’ve always felt a bit fucked up even before this had happened.

Since the age of about 10 or 11 I knew I’d die of suicide, it just felt like something I was supposed to do, maybe because my dad was suicidal. Either way I’ve been self harming and idealising suicide since a young age.

I’ve recently been discharged from the military for my suicidal history and BPD and I don’t really want to live in this world for the following reasons.

1) I really don’t feel safe in the world, there are rapists and sexual predators everywhere and I know I cannot protect myself.

2) I really cannot manage my emotions, I’d rather not live a life feeling this pain.

3) My pessimistic outlook on life just makes sense to me. I really believe we are all born to die so why not skip to the end. I barely find pleasure in living anymore and the thought of death is peaceful to me.

4) I’m pretty obsessed with suicide. My doctor said this is very abnormal. I literally think about it 24/7 and I cannot stop. I even commit suicide in my dreams.

I’ve been “experimenting” with suicide. I’ve tried multiple methods to a very dangerous point and I’m not comfortable with my method.

As I’ve been experimenting a lot over the past few months, the military and doctors barely take me seriously anymore and it’s starting to make me think that I’m wasting their time. I really believe that the next “experiment” will be a completed suicide and I plan to complete it this week.

"Fuck this shit, I'm done. (F15)","I'm scared of people. I had two interactions with pedophiles.  
I went to this central (Australian Mall) and we were walking around, mind you I was 10. I was walking with my mum to the bathroom and this dude who was sitting on a chair with 4 friends grabbed my arm from my elbow down and had this scary smile on his face so I yanked my arm away and ran off.  


Then another when I was the same age, I was at a pool and this dude who had jail tattoo's was around me and showing off, he was really handsy and grabbing my sides and hips.  
I didn't really understand as I was 10.  
Then the man who owns the local pool called my mum and we went home.   


To top it off.  


When I was 6 years old this dude who I had no fucking clue who he was, he was the son of a family friend.  
Anyways! The mum asked me to go get him, mind you there were a shit tonne of sons.  
I went up, he waved me over, I was also in a dress which I hated.  


So he told me to go on his bed and I did as said, I crawled to the end to look at the posters and at the time I didn't know that skirts lifted up.  
So he was touching himself while looking at my ass.

Longstory short.  


He came in his hand and then he waved me over, he made me touch his dick, getting him off and he also made me rub his legs, chest, stomach and face, of course, his dick as well.  
The fact that he made me do that shit...  


He tried advancing on me as well.  
So I pushed him off and then he slapped me and screamed at me to fuck off.  
So I was BALLING my eyes out and I got to the bathroom, washed his CUM off my hand and then I ran downstairs.  


Another thing, as I had my back to him as I looked at the posters, he grabbed my fucking ass-

I sit in this house alone day after day evening after evening just thinking about the memories where I used to tell myself how lucky I was .I used to feel so loved. I used to feel like these people were my future and then I learned that the entire thing was a lie. I used to feel like my life was so full.

I pretty much need a guarantee things will improve enough at this point,"I really don't know how much longer I can deal with being miserable.

My downstairs neighbour keeps complaining about me. They say that I walk too heavily even when I try to walk lightly. I haven't slept in my bedroom in months because of this. They've even accused me of doing drugs, which they know is complete nonsense.

I've been made to feel like I'm not allowed to have an opinion on things I enjoy if it goes against the popular opinion, getting bullied no matter what. I'm very anxious, enough so that it is debilitating and ruining my life. I'm a complete loser and have no friends. I don't feel comfortable enough using my family as a support system. Even though I know I need to, I don't want to get help with this stuff or talk to someone about it because I feel like I'm bothering them since I'm so useless, not worth getting help, and such a waste of space, and don't want to make them angry. I'm nervous about making this post for the same reasons. Plus, doctors are way too expensive.

I'm learning a profession but I don't even know if that's what I wanna do since there's almost nothing I like to do anymore.

People never really cared about me. When my dad died 2 years ago, no one supported me except my sister and my mom because no one even bothered to take news from me during the lockdown. When I get rejected by girls, I just get laughed at. Everytime I ask for help, everyone just say that my problems are dumb. 

I'm tired of bothering everyone, tired of being used by people, tired of being different, tired of being told i'm okay, tired of everything. I'll never belong anywhere.

02/08/22,"02/09/22 hospitalization 
Diagnosis: Rhabdomyolysis 
CPK level: 68,000 U/L

On this day I went dealt with my second official attempt. First one was back in 09/28/14 in high school.

Anyway, I don't know how to explain this but the weeks prior to this happening I had already known I was going to try, maybe not a specific day but the way I'd go about it was set in stone. I stumbled across prescribed fentynl patches from someone who had passed and shamelessly swiped them for my own selfish agenda.

I sent out vague good byes to the very few people I like and value, making sure to compliment them and tell them they're doing great and telling them they'll do great things in their life, some warm heart felt messages and apologies too. 


2PM
 The day of the deed I bought about 3 litre of vodka and drank all of it in an after noon and while I was drunk but conscious, i took the patches and chewed on em for an hour. 

4PM - 6PM
My last hours I spent playing Call of duty online with some acquaintances because thats where I can truly feel calm and at peace and was on discord calls with closer acquaintances.

Unknown Timeline*

I ended up losing consciousness while online, slouched to the side almost leaning off my gaming chair. 
I sat there for hours, my body straining itself to grasp for air made an incredibly loud and scary sounding snoring sound apparently called a death rattle by some seasoned opioid users. My sister was going to work that day and woke up to find me like that and was became concerned. From what im told she held my head up right until she had to leave for work. My father was there but they were both unaware of the situation and my dad convinced my sister I must have just been drunk out cold.

After a while my father laid me out on the floor with a pillow. 

I woke up.

My first thoughts..... im still here..  

I tried to get up but my legs failed me. My legs and my arms and hands were in horrendous pain, which  intensified by moving. I was in so much pain but my posterior, legs and feet were numb. My arms and hands also numb too but accompanied by pins and needle sensation.
I crawled to the bathroom when I needed too and it was  something I'd never thought I'd get to experience. 

Im 6'1 300lb 

I was groaning yelling from the pain.

My sister came back from work in the morning and I told her what was going on with my body acting confused as to why it was happening and doing my best to compose myself as to not seem in too much pain but it was difficult. She asked our father what we should do and both were indecisive, finally I said call the hospital and they did. Fire and rescue came to assess everything and they helped me to my fathers car so I could be taken to the ER. 


M.D. explained to me that being unconscious for that prolonged period of time cut the circulation to some parts of my body, also the lack of movement caused my muscles to begin breaking down. 

Overall I'm not okay. I am still feeling the consequences, my hands have feeling again and I can finally walk again without pain but still have poor balance. Some parts of my posterior remain numb.

Im super scared of losing him and i don't know if i should give him space or keep bothering him. Worst case scenario i can contact his parents about him and maybe get them to try and help him but I'm scared that if i do that he wont trust me to tell me when he feels like this and that would scare me even more hes at a point where he sleeps all day cause he thinks theres no point into trying to feel better and no matter what i say helps.

How can I help my autistic brother who wants to die?,"For context I (17) have an older brother (19) with schizophrenia and autism who has tried to kill himself multiple times. He has auditory hallucinations, extreme intrusive thoughts and talks to characters inside of his head. He’s sort of at a child’s level of understanding and comprehension. Theres not really any relationship between us (which started as kids as he used to be verbally aggressive and for the longest time I felt threatened by him). No communication is had and we barely talk and at that it’s only about laundry or other small things like that. Our mother died about ten years ago and our dad takes care of him. Work is more promising in another country, but before departing I’d like to make an effort to establish some sort of relationship for his sake him if I can. I’ve got my license so I’d like to drive around with him and try to give him some advice or companionship if I can (He’s always wanted to have friends but he doesn’t have any social skills or the grasp to learn any as of now). I do love him even though I’m not really good at communicating that, but I’d like an opinion as to what I could talk to him about to help him. He’s got very bizarre (to me at least) sorts of interests and regularly talks about furries and fetishes that I’d rather not know about, though its hard not to because he’s very vocal about it. I know I may sound ignorant or cold talking about him, but mind I’ve dealt with and seen a lot I wish I hadn’t, and in my own selfish way I want to at-least try to help him for my own comfort as I’m deathly afraid that one day he’ll succeed in his goal. He’s been in and out of psych wards his entire life and he’s not in immediate danger currently I’d like to add. I’m sure this is all coming off as very ignorant but it’s hard for me to cram as many details into a small bit of text. I’m also not too sure this is the right place for this sort of thing so if it isn’t please let me know where I can get some advice - I’m desperate.",WeHaveOneShot,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tuxujr/how_can_i_help_my_autistic_brother_who_wants_to/

I think about suicide but remind myself of the people who will pretend they actually gave a fuck about me. No way will i give them that satisfaction. I’m so lonely.

Black pill trash is real and I need to end my life because of it,"I'm 31 years old now. Never had a relationship, dates, sex without paying for it etc.  
The reason for this is I'm not up to beauty standards for men in my society in any way and my avoiding personality, which also grew from beeing ugly.

Everyday is just pain. The sexual desperation is agonizing but the lonliness is hell. And I know it will never end.

People who have never been in this situation can't understand and make up lies. A life without intimitate relationships is just not worth it. Romantic love and sex is an integral part of life for the majority of humanity. I get very angry when people try to deny this.

There is no reason to go any further. I consume now a lot of drugs until it kills me to get at least some joy of my life. Love going into the K-Hole, it's almost like death. I guess I can do this for a few years until I die.

Also I engage in bar fights and arguments on the street. I do not fucking care anymore. If it gets me killed, that's fine. I'm not going to take any bullshit of arrogant women and superior men anymore.

"Health issues, not lonely.","One of my reasons to not want to live anymore isn’t because I’m lonely or don’t feel loved, in fact I have a good group of friends and I’m a likable person. I’v always had an easy time attracting the opposite sex. My overall life isn’t too bad, i’v always hated life in this capitalist society, but there were things that kept me wanting to stay alive, one of those things being music. I absolutely love music, festivals, raves ect, anything that has to do with music I love. Music has been an outlet and a clutch to dig me out of my most darkest moments in my life, and despite sometimes life being complete shit, i’v always had music to bail me out of my misery. Well that has been taken away from me, I have been suffering with severe tinnitus and hyperacusis(extreme sensitivity to sound) so I’m mainly restricted to being in quite places and I can’t go to music festivals anymore, to say that this is heart-breaking would be an injustice. I have been dealing with a lot of health issues since I can remember, from chronic migraines that would knock me out almost unconscious, to a lot of nerve pain through my body( mainly shoulder and hands). Working out was also an outlet for me out of this mundane lifestyle under a capitalist society, I can’t do that anymore due to my many injuries. I have a list of other health issues that seem to keep piling up, anxiety ect things that I can’t remember. To top this all off my girlfriend committed suicide a month ago, and this really has me questioning why is it that I’m still willing to suffer despite life continuous cycle of torture. There is a list of other things as of why I want to end things, but that would consist of me writing a whole book. I just want to see if I can relate to anyone here, that isn’t lonely but is considering ending their life over mainly health issues and possibly just society as a whole ? My body is just so broken, I don’t see how I will ever improve enough to make life at least a bit enjoyable. Tinnitus and hyperacusis aren’t curable, only mainly mildly treatable and susceptible to a lot of setbacks. I’m just tired of always being physically in pain, I’m only 28 and I don’t see how I can possibly keep going past even 30. I still love some aspects of life despite living under capitalism, but the things I loved the most have been taken away from me, one of them being music. I just want someone to relate to me, I’m still afraid of dying, but the possibility of ending my life by suicide becomes an even better option as the days and months pass. I just hate being in pain, I’m tired of it. I’v been fighting health issues since I’ve been a kid, I can’t catch a fucking break.

Loneliness and Injury might kill me,"Hello. 
This will be a really long read. But I need someone , anyone, to know what I have experienced and why I will probably make the darkest of choices soon. I want someone in the world to know who I was before my story is gone forever. Not nsfw or graphic, just long. And a downer.

Since I was very little  I had an obsession with drawing. Whenever asked what I wanted to do when I grew up the answer was always ""draw stuff!""
Much to my parents' annoyance and later worry, I would draw constantly, especially in my school books.
I was a loner, but partially by choice I guess.
I would decline playing with others because I wanted to be better at drawing. This continued into my teens. A party? Nah, I want to become a great artist, I need to draw.
Hang out? Naw, I have to draw 100 hands today. I didn't have friends to begin with, but my obsession drove away even casual acquintances. This continued well into my 20s. Friendless. Loveless. Lonely. But I had to get better at art. My art was always mediocre, so bad compared to other artists. I wanted to live off of drawing and painting beautiful things, I had to improve, always.

My way to cope with how lonely I'd get from time to time were video games. In my mid-20s I realized how badly I actually wanted friends so I tried to connect with people I knew before, but they didn't want to reestablish contact. Polite refusals all around, or a really awkward meeting followed by ghosting.
My social skills were in the toilet I guess, I must've seemed so weird to them.
So life went on. No friends. And my family thought me weird too. My mom and dad cut me off after they learned that I was trans as well, so by the age of 23 I was well and truly 100% alone, hated my own body, and was still bad at the thing I had dedicated my life to.

I had a lot of trouble landing a job as well. My art was really poor, nobody would order commissions or hire me.
Other career options were closed to me, as I had no skills. I struggled for 5 years on bare-bones welfare before a charity program landed me grunt work in a factory in the middle of absolute nowhere.

Work gave me something to focus on aside from art, crushing loneliness and self loathing.
Then after one year, my back started aching.
It turns out my spine can't really handle physical strain at all, and my job is literally breaking it.
And due to really messed up rules pertaining to work places and health, I'm basically stuck working until my back finally gives way, at which point I will live on welfare again as an invalid.

Meanwhile on the social side of things, I've tried reaching out online. I grew more and more desperate for someone, anyone to communicate with. In real life nobody seems to want to interact with me, but maybe online?
Yes and no. People would enthusiastically greet me on various forums or in online games, but never really wanting to be real friends. They would just stop replying to me or just state to me that they're not really looking to make friends in the forum or game I met them in.

I asked many if I did something wrong, came across as too eager or weird, but to this day, I have not gotten a real answer, a reason for why people seem so keen to break contact with me and disappear.
I like to think that I am polite, optimistic and agreeable in conversation, but this always happen, as if I'm breaking some unspoken social rule and people are forbidden to tell me what it is.

On top of that, two years ago I realized that my art skills just... suck.
I'm bad at it. At age 29, after putting TENS OF THOUSANDS of hours into drawing, it's still at the level of ""decent for a 16-year old who just dabblrs in it.""
My life-long obsession, that I gave up my formative years to pursue.
I laid down my pencil as I realized how I'm just not meant to be anything beyond mediocre at my passion. There are late bloomers, then there are the outright incompetent.

So here I am today, and this is my routine:
I wake up alone in mybone-person bed, checking my email, discord, skype, all of them with zero new messages in them.
I go to work, where the best I get out of people is a polite ""hello"" or short requests.
I go home, my back killing me at this point, and lie on the couch.
I stare emptily into the room, until it's time for bed.
Repeat ad nauseum.

I used to gain at least a bit of distraction from gaming, sneaking in an hour of play if my back pains allowed for it, but even that, I can't handle emotionally any more.
I get jealous of the characters I play.
They gain friends. They overcome challenges.
When my in-game character received a loving hug from an AI character, something broke in me.
I realized that I'm 31 and have no idea what a hug feels like.
I have no idea what it feels like to have someone smile at me and say ""I like you."" To receive a touch on the shoulder, a kiss, or just someone saying to me: ""you are my friend.""

I live in the middle of nowhere, there are no social venues or opportunities here to ""go out and meet people"".
I cannot drive to the nearest large town, my back simply can't handle a car trip that long.
Nobody online seems to want anything to do with me, same with people I used to know in my childhood years.
My family won't talk to me because of who I am inside.
My lifelong dream has been shattered due to my own inability to learn.
In probably less than a year, I will be a cripple, either stuck with permanent crutches or wheelchair bound, and out of a job.
I am so lonely that I've hired voice actors to record themselves saying nice things and including my name, because it's the only way I will ever hear it.
And if I can't walk in the future, the only thing that occasionally makes me smile anymore, walks outside in nature, will be taken from me.

I want to believe that life and the world is beautiful and worthwhile.
I want to appreciate all the wonder that I know is out there.
I want to smile again, I want to laugh, I want to love, I want someone, anyone, to one day say to me: ""It's good to see you.""

I fear that when, soon, my health reaches the point where I'm unable to move around freely, I will have run out of excuses to be positive.
I am so afraid that when it happens, I will choose the unthinkable.
I want to live, but I fear that soon I will not want to. Please help me. I want a reason to keep living.",weeWooZe,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tuytbu/loneliness_and_injury_might_kill_me/

Slowly losing hope,"Throwaway since people who know me know my main reddit account. 

Hey everyone I guess I'm here since I don't know where to post this. Guess I'm exhausted from life itself. Tired into the family I was born into. I wish I was born into a healthy safe family where having a boyfriend, getting a job, being my own person, etc. was a thing and not looked down upon. I wish being a daughter wasn't so bad in my culture (Muslim, bengali girl). Being 21 isn't too old to get married in fact I'd say I'm too young. I have a loving boyfriend (28M) he gave me hope that I would leave this hellhole of my home but I understand where he's coming from. We discussed about getting a small condo/house (apartment prices here are ridiculous) and he has enough to put a down payment if we find a place. However he just said I have to put in some as well, yes I know it's reasonable. The original plan was for me to escape and then pay back slowly. For context my dad owns all of my original documents, from passports to social security etc. They open all my mail from bank statements etc. I had a job for a short while however after they found out I made friends with my co workers they basically banned me from working. Awhile back they caught me with my boyfriend and banned me from going out. I basically have no way to currently help my bf pay, I thought about setting up a kickstarter or something to maybe get some help but at this rate it might be better to end it and stop having anyone to deal with me and my situation. My mental state is at a shitshow due to literally being stuck in my room. My parents guilt tripped me so bad for taking meds that I broke down and stopped. I wish I never existed.

Suicidal ideation is returning; need help staying safe,"Hi. I recently got some pretty bad news. Its nothing life threatening, but my sole dream is now far out of my reach. I am a very good pianist, and I have worked diligently every day for years, even to the point of almost total mental deterioration. I’ve forsaken friendships and at one point I was blinded by this dream so brightly that I lost touch with someone I love. I have changed over the course of three years to this specter of sorts, haunting the halls of my boarding school with my humming of Chopin nocturnes and rachmaninoff preludes. I was not bullied for it, but many people came to the consensus that I should not be talked to. So in the times I try to seek friendships I’m often just ignored. It’s the polite form of bullying, a more upper class way of insulting someone. But all it does to me is reinforce my ghostly presence. I catch myself involuntarily scowling at these people if I see them from behind my piano. However, I was able to accept all of this in the name of the dream; to perform for audiences as a solo classical piano virtuoso. Now, that is over. I have had 3 different piano teachers over three years of high school. This would be a big enough setback for anyone to give up. I almost did because my piano teacher of year 2 was someone who really took time to know me, care for me, and I thank her for unlocking love and joy from my cruel heart. However when she left I became devastated, but with the summer’s passing I was able to talk to the new piano teacher and gain some confidence. This new teacher wants to round me out as although I was working on Chopin’s 1st ballade as a sophomore, I wasn’t doing any Mozart and zero baroque. This new teacher fixed me, and now I am a decent student of Bach after completing a prelude and fugue. And now I’m so close, all I have to do is learn the college level repertoire. And I was talking to the teacher about it for a while, and we made plans. Then days later I hear she quit. Now, I have no teacher to help me with the most crucial part of this process. I’m at a loss. The spectre has become a tortured soul, and I constantly sport an expression agape, like an ugly fish gasping for water on a dock. And I am much like that fish. I can see the gutting knife come close. All I can do is wait for the cutting to begin. For the blood to spill. For the misery to end.",Kris_Krispy,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tuuo54/suicidal_ideation_is_returning_need_help_staying/

It doesn't matter how much I eat, how much I sleep it's constant exhaustion, I can barely stay awake during the day and there's not a single thing I can do about it, I ate 4-5 hefty meals and it made no difference, why have I got no energy?

I'm tired of doubting myself, I'm tired of everything constantly eating away at me all of the time, I try so hard to get it together, but what use is it if nothing fuels me, lets say I finally succeed in my job search, with what energy am I going to complete that?

I tried the crisis team, I tried the doctors, I tried medication, I tried therapy, I tried exercise, I tried healthy eating, I tried a sleep schedule, I tried friends and social circles, I tried and it's never good enough for my body, ever since I was 9 I've had depression, now in it's most severe stage to date.

I'm just a broken machine with lost disfigured parts that they can't remake,

I hate this feeling, I want it to stop but I can't I made a promise to myself and I just can't break it, instead, I just exist, I don't survive I just exist, I sleep all day, I don't bother eating unless someone else offers, I just exist for the world to break down until I'm finally free in the ashes thrown to the wind.

I'm tired of this endless cycle of picking myself up and self-sabotaging myself.,"I fucking hate this cycle of picking myself up and relapsing and self sabotaging myself again.

November 2020, I picked up a bike and went cycling and already started quitting smoking for 6 months. Was jobless and barely got enough money to get a bike but I did. For 3 months, I rode my bike as far as I can go. Lost around 20kg 105kg got myself down to 85kg give or take. Met a reliable friend to talk to. Then I got a freelance job. Focused 100% of my time for that job barely rode my bike for months. Had a big fight with this friend, lost her. Working full-time at this freelance job now, consistent and bigger pay. Got over complacent. Got depressed and started smoking again.

Picked myself up. Started being honest with self. Stopped smoking after 2 months. By February this year, I Gained all that I lost and more and 5 months out of smoking. Now at 115kg. Started riding my bike. The job that I'm at is giving me bigger tasks, grooming me for a higher post. Met a beautiful woman online and had a few dates. Started missing deadlines at work. Stopped riding my bike after a month. Girl dumped me yesterday. Started overeating to take the pain away, not because I like this  


I'm just timed of this endless cycle of things getting better and then suddenly losing it... I'm tired of losing focus on what is important and everything falling apart.

I just want someone to hear me out for the last time ever.,"Hello, I'm a 22 years old (Male) from Greece.

I don't want to talk about my life specifically but in general, since I was born, it's like I came to a world of hell..I don't like this life and I want to finally rest somehow..I'm just too tired to keep moving on.

From a young age I had psychological issues..at home every day we have a battle, every single day - 22 years now - is a mess, my mother sadly is an alcoholic who steals money from me and cheats on my father who is a gambler and loses a lot of money to the point of us starving and having a very poor and basically trash quality life.

They are both toxic and very abusive and definitely ruined this ""family"" but I don't care about them anymore, even if they die, they numbed all my positive feelings about life in general. I can feel pain but I can't feel pleasure and happiness 95% of the time.

Also my life is a failure: I failed at school, i don't have happy childhood memories at all, I was bullied, girls were making fun of me and a lot of other things that will take me days to mention them all, financially I'm in a very bad spot aswell, i lost all my friends because i stoped talking to them, my future is very dark. Everything is my fault due to mistakes I have made..or most of, if not everything.

I'm at that point where I suffer from panic attacks, psychosomatic symptoms, depression, etc. I'm also bipolar, the only feelings I have in my heart is immense rage, pain, pressure and the huge desire to take revenge..

Out of all this I had an almost 3 years relationship with a girl too.

She broke up with me. I'm not mad at her. I love her. This almost 3 years was the best years of my life..She is the only human that I was ever be able to love and care about.

I don't want to be too much specific about it but before her I was just a moving corpse and dead inside, she actually revived me and did make me a better person, I wanted to change and be better but I made big mistakes and I lost her. She broke up with me because I just simply did some mistakes. It was my fault, she is a wonderful person and I didn't deserve her at all. This time seems like I can't get her back.

This girl is absolute right to feel that way, I respect her choice, I did some mistakes and nothing is at her fault, she was unhappy with me and I respect that she wants to stay away from me.

She said that she wants something else. Someone else that will give her what she wants. She said that she doesn't like the way I am as a human, she told me that I was an empty person, a man who can't offer her neither love, protection, or anything else..

She said that I have many issues and thoughts that I never talk about and she can't be with a dude who's so fucked up inside. She loved me for sure, I felt that, she was just unhappy with me.

I love her so much, I miss her so much and I understand her.

This is the way I am, I'm probably hard to love or something like that..

Right now I'm in a hotel room away from everyone and wondering if anyone would actually care (besides my dog) if I decided to rest..

Tonight is probably the last night of my life. At this point I'm not asking for advice or something, this is just my last text to someone.

Yesterday i got my payment of 800€ of the month and I've decided to spend them well.

I bought flowers with a letter for my ex girlfriend and scheduled them to be delivered at Monday.

I've bought already : 10 Xanax pills of 3MG, 8 Lexotanil pills of 6MG.

I also have some very good quality weed and food with me.

I'm going to listen to my favorite songs one last time.

I told the people here on the hotel to not disturb me until the morning.

I've bought a lot of beers, a big bottle of vodka and whiskey.

I'm going to do the things I like for the last time ever and have some fun before dying from overdosing mix of pills, alcohol and weed.

I already had an amazing day fully playing with my dog, I confessed everything to her and I will miss her, and I also had one last big ride with my motorcycle. That's it.

TW: I survived an OD,"On July 9th, I decided to take my own life. I took 360 pills along with liquor. I was fading quick while my friend was banging on my bathroom door. I could feel my body getting weaker, my veins pulsing slowly, my heart beat softening and my lips tingling. The music in the background was fading in and out until I woke up in the ambulance for a split second hearing, “She’s coding.” My final thought was, “I really did it.” I then woke back up in a hospital bed there were three nurses by my bedside. There were restraints holding down my wrists and ankles, a tube down my throat, IV’s in my arm, a cord in my neck pumping me with drugs, and bandages on my arm from the cuts down my forearm. I tried to move, resisting the restrains as much as I could, along with chewing on the tube. I’ve never been so scared in my life. As I was trying to get out of the restraints, a nurse to my right was yelling at me to “stop chewing on my tube,” because she didn’t want to change it. I had just woken up from the most terrifying experience of my life, I didn’t even know my own name at the time. Another nurse finally stepped in, “could you stop yelling at her, can’t you tell she’s scared?” I guess reality hit that nurse. I was hospitalized in the ICU for four days, and in the psych unit for 7. My recovery in the ICU was the worst part of my stay. For three days, they didn’t know if I was going to make it. My mother didn’t know if her own daughter was going to live… I was hallucinating from the drugs, blacking in and out, my heart rate was constantly going up and down, I was in the worst possible shape I could’ve been in. Once they removed the tube from my throat I immediately threw up blood. It was difficult to breathe on my own at first from what I can remember. Once I could finally talk after two days, nothing but gibberish came out of my mouth. Every thought I had, everything I wanted to desperately say couldn’t come out correct; I couldn’t even write. I cried because everything I wanted to say wasn’t coming out right. It was a never ending hell, I was honestly wishing I had died. Eventually I was able to talk right again, which I was then transported to the psych unit. The first night there was hard; I was lonely and questioned why I was even alive. I noticed that I had done nerve damage to three fingers from self harming myself. I had to practice some physical therapy techniques to regain strength in them again (they still tingle to this day, but it’s not sever anymore). I went the full seven days there, and was released early since I was going to receive after care, along with living with a friend since I was no longer able to live by myself for a while. I guess the only reason I’m sharing this is because I’ve been having some pretty sever ptsd attacks lately and just need to share my story. Get it out there so others can see what I went through, and possibly help someone see what it’s like to die and come back (I was dead, but was brought back in the ambulance. They put a central line in me and pumped my heart with three epinephrines). I hope I can get through this, because not everyone gets a second chance like me. There has to be a reason I did, right? Idk. I hope my story helps someone out there struggling like me.",BoneyardHorizons,15,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tub5lz/tw_i_survived_an_od/
Fuck This,"For most of my life, I've always just wanted to die I didn't care for a future or any plans it's already a struggle just to try and live. I always told myself maybe it'll get better so I just ignore those thoughts and just go along with life but after my dad caught a stroke we've been more financially unstable and I began to break more and more I stopped going to college without explaining anything to anyone, but I was forced to again the next few semesters and I failed 4 semesters in a row so I got kicked out.

I tried to kill myself back in October I drank a shit ton of alcohol and some antidepressants, at that moment I think I remember vomiting and as I blackout I felt a huge sense of relief I thought it was all over but I woke up at a hospital then was bought to a psychiatric ward shortly after, I felt so frustrated and guilty for all the money I wasted and for living and having to continue living.

I got a little better as months go by but I knew this was just pretty pointless, I will never escape this hell that is living. I enrolled in a new college this February I hated every second of it but I did every requirement attended every class and did group work. It all felt so pointless and empty but I know living in a 3rd world country without a degree is not really good. All my siblings already graduated and have moved on with their lives.

Now I'm here, no dream no plan no motivation no will to live. I don't want anything or anyone in life I'm just done. I never wanted this life I might try and end it all again",Isolateddark,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tujxo2/fuck_this/
Screwed Over By YouTube,"NOTE: I've made a throwaway account to hide my identity. Hope you don't mind.

It has been a long and rather hectic story so I'm going to do my best to cut to the chase. I have no friends and barely any family and my life is going in almost no direction.

Myself and my friend have been running a YouTube channel for the last two years now. The two of us have been roommates to survive this world since our jobs don't pay that much. 

I'm not here to plug or promote myself but we have ran a channel of under 50k subscribers. We average about 10k viewers per video with a few occasionally reaching upwards of over 200k views. We spend about 3 hours a day making new videos. We began around March of 2020 and managed to find unexpected success, even getting monetized on May of that same year. We've never made too much money but it's definitely an amount that's helped us through these shitty times.

That is, until January of 2022. Unexpectedly, YouTube demonetized our channel and that we no longer fit their Partner Program guidelines. The reason claimed was due to ""Reused Content"" (whatever that means) That's it. Vague, unspecific, and without any real definition.

This was also just a few days before we were to release a new series. We spent over two months editing day and night only for YouTube to fuck us over last minute.

Not to worry, right? All we need to do is edit/delete the videos YouTube deemed ""unfit"", right? Well, for the next month or so (since it takes a month before you can reapply) we worked our asses off to delete every video that we were worried were deemed unfit. Our channel of 250+ videos was cut to about only 100.  We thought we were in the clear but as it turned out, YouTube STILL didn't think we fit in the program. 

We spent another month cutting our 100 videos to only 50, losing a shitload of views in the process. We wanted in on this program so if any video too risky for YouTube it would unfortunately have to be deleted. I reapplied to the program a few days ago and just yesterday we were rejected again. 

We have ended up deleting over 200 videos. Countless hours of review and analysis have led to nothing as YouTube somehow sees the channel as unfit for monetization. To make matters worse, my computer is nearing the end of its life (fucking 10 year old Macbooks...) and I just don't have the funds to buy a new one anytime soon (even a cheap one would set our funds back by a lot)

If only YouTube wasn't so fucking vague and actually TOLD US specifically what we were doing wrong. ""Reused Content"" is such an umbrella term that barely fucking means anything. It absolutely fucking sucks that a hobby my friend and I have invested so much time and effort in has to go down the drain because YouTube doesn't want to be direct by stating what its problem with our channel is.

Long story short, I'm really at the end of my rope here. I know I sound fairly spoiled and pretentious by making something as modern and first-worldy (though I do live in a ""third world country"") as a YouTube channel get the better of me but I don't know what to fucking do anymore. 

I've wasted the last two years of my life and YouTube absolutely refuses to elaborate on what we did wrong in the first place. what was once an escape from my disappointing reality has manifested into suicidal thoughts and anxiety. Our work wasn't for nothing (we were able to have a nice amount of ""spare change"" from the 1 year and 8 months of our monetization) but what was once a crux to help us survive seems to be no longer possible. It doesn't help that we've gotten rid of 80% of our backlog of videos either.

And the worst part? After delaying our ""massive series"" by three months, we decided to just release it a few days ago. And guess what? It's actually been fairly popular!!! Our most popular videos in the last eight months!! But none of the fucking funds we would've made are going our way because YouTube decided to fuck us in the ass.

I'm not worthy,"Although I tell myself everything will get better....nothing changes, I don't change.

I'm not worthy of my parents affection, efforts and money that they've spent on me.

As each day passes and the ultimate deadline approaches I feel like killing myself.

Hiding in my room when guests visit. Not stepping out of my house. And only going out at times when I'm sure I won't be seen by people who know me.

Afraid that if I meet them then all they've said about me will come true. Afraid that my bullies will gloat over my despair (maybe I'm just overthinking but I've been proven wrong).

Looking at my dad who goes to office everyday even though his coworkers abuse him , even though he has severe health conditions makes me feel like a piece of shit for being such a failure.

I've overheard my parents talking about how they only wish for me to be happy and to succeed in whatever I do. Such supportive and kind parents who've gone through a ton of hardships and I can do nothing to ease their burden. Infact I've become a burden.

I've become the black sheep of my family. My mom has got nothing to talk about when her friends and relatives brag about their kids academics and careers. What can she brag about a kid who's cooped up in her room moping.

Where did it go wrong? I wanted to make them happy, to make them proud, I've worked so hard.....why did I end up like this lazy good for nothing? Why do I not change even after all this humiliation and crisis?

Whenever I see people with dysfunctional families, people who go to school, work part time jobs and take care of their families, people with incurable diseases, etc giving it all they've got and succeeding in life...I feel it's unfair I wish God had given such diligent individuals as a child to my parents inplace of me.

I feel like I don't deserve my parents love and affection. Everytime they do something nice for me I feel guilty...that it's not my place to receive their love.

My best friend might have to move to another country soon. I know it is not the end of the world, really, I do, but it would just be one more fucking thing on top of the pile of shit that is my life. And if I'm gonna draw the line somewhere, not seeing my best friend anymore will be that line. Of course I would wait a few months after they move, just to make it less of a burden on them. But I've become very firm on this decision over all. Life is barely worth it anymore. This would be the last straw.

I don't know why I feel the need to share this here, I will not go into much more detail, I don't want anyones pity and I'm just too exhausted. I just needed to get this off my chest and I can't stand to hurt my friends by telling them.


Maybe one more thing...
Sometimes I think that maybe some people just aren't meant to live. And I'm pretty sure I'm one of them. If there is any purpose to life at all, surely it is having fun. But what if some people are too afraid to live? What if some people constantly worry and stress, never able to relax and actually have fun?

He quickly started pressuring me into intimacy, saying it would make him happy and that it would show how much I trusted him, so I went with it as bad as it made me feel sometimes.

But then he started telling me he didn't love me, so if I wanted to be with him, I had to have no expectations for him to treat me well. I was so wrapped up in his initial promises that I tried to comply, but his treatment would get so bad I would inevitably break down, each time my behavior would get more extreme in response, and at this point, I have already attempted suicide several times and had humiliating outbursts demanding he keep the promises he made, because I genuinely only feel normal when he is.

For the past year and a half, I have been in hell. He's put me through a rollercoaster so many times, I just can't function anymore, even with all the medication, hospitalizations, therapy, nothing is helping. My incredible friends and family are suffering seeing how much I've changed, and they really can't help me either. I even got a new job I enjoy and a bf who cares about me, but I am miserable. I can't be happy with him, and I am in extreme pain without him. So I just don't see why I should keep making everyone and myself suffer like this.",FoggyNightSky,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tuqupb/i_really_tried_but_i_see_no_way_out_anymore/

I genuinely don’t know if i want to live or not anymore,"Hi everyone I am 23 years old and a male and I am going through the worst calendar year I’ve ever been through in my entire life. I was forced to go away to a college in the fall that I’ve done online for the past year and a half because in person classes started. I saw this as a new opportunity, but I managed to get screwed by life the entire time.

The one friend that I had when I went prior to the pandemic was moving so I only saw her once. My apartment was a shithole, I met a girl who manipulated me into a relationship with her. I had no friends, I barely left the apartment/dorm (I ended up living with her because there was a mold problem) and I had no one to turn to. 

I broke up with my girl friend and cut her out of my life. I’ve tried to bounce back but no one seems to want me or put effort into talking to me. 

I managed to get out of the lease and moved back home. Covid was bad again so I barely went out for months, school has been stressing me out, and life in general has been so bad. 14 days ago I managed to completely ruin my friend group and lost my best friend single-handedly. I lied to her when I shouldn’t have and threw some people under the bus. I haven’t really seen anyone besides my parents, my friends who weren’t involved have been so distant towards me.

About Me &amp; Social Anxiety," Hi im new here and i wanted to make a venting post about my situation in general.  
First off, i have severe Social Anxiety and i'm extremely ""Introverted"".  
Currently i don't have any IRL friends, i just talk to my online friends via texting on discord but its not too serious, just something i like doing for fun.  
I was always the quiet girl in class and all the friends i had were just temporary depending on the class, i never really talked to them due to my shyness, and obiously those friendships faded away by now:(  
When i talk to people, even my dad, i can't keep eye contact and its just so painful to think about how i look to them.  
Recently i been going for walks around my neighborhood, park.. sometimes its relaxing.. but i can't stop thinking about how other people see me, or what they think.. i know this is like something people always tell u to don't think and don't mind but it's super complicated for me.  
Everytime i see guys/girls my age i cant help but compare myself and get sad over how i can't seem to make friends. (also i get really shy and awkward around people my age).  
About dating and relationships.. i always been told im cute and i like to remember that, but the past years i've tried to talk people that i like and they seem to like me i just end up always backing out and ghosting them, and i hate this about me..  
Something i really like is Fashion and making/buying clothes, i have always been into it, when i dress up and look in the mirror.. im like it looks super cute, but when im walking out its another story, its not like im not comfortable in them but i start to think they suck and i did a bad job. I think lowly of me in all aspects :( and i can't seem to fix this.  


Those are some of troubles that i've had for the most of my life.  
Nowadays i just sit on the computer thinking about the quick way out, im just getting tired of all this, that i don't think i will ever fix.. im not happy and i can't keep pretending i am happy.  


The main reason that is holding me back are my parents, my parents have always been so good to me, and understanding of everything i do, i love them with all my heart.  
My dad recently had a heart attack in 2020 and he survived but recently he's not been feeling too good.  
I'm an only child so that would mean my mom would probably be alone soon :( and i hate to have that thought.  


I'm lonely, and i don't seem to work in the world, i cannot hold a simple conversation or be a normal girl that socializes with other people her age. And i will never fix it i am too scared of everything that involves it:(  


This will be my freshman year in college and honestly i don't know if im going to even reach that date, im just coming into a conclusion now, im very sad, and thoughts can't leave me alone lately:(  


I have never taken any meds or went to therapy for kind of the same reasons i'm sorry.  


If anyone reading this has similar feelings and would like to share help, talk etc. i would appreciate it a lot, thank you&lt;3",noraily,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tuu9y5/about_me_social_anxiety/
Why am I so worthless?,"I’m going through life on easy mode, supportive parents, ok financial situation, even some friends, but all I do is waste all of it. I have anxiety meds and they used to help but even with them I feel completely worthless and think about ending it all the time. If the problem with me was really just the mental illness then I would be fine now. The fact that it’s getting worse means that the problem is just with me, with who I am as a person. 

I have no personality, no goals and I don’t care about anything. Nothing about me is worthwhile at all and nothing would change if I had never existed. I feel like I have no soul, like some part of me is just missing or broken and I could be easily replaced by a robot. 

I can hear my flatmates all talking in the living room without me and they sound so happy. They wouldn’t lose anything if I disappeared. Same with my parents, all I ever do is burden them with my issues. All I can think about is how much I wish nobody cared about me. Nothing they do will fix the fact that I don’t deserve to exist, but I can’t kill myself without hurting them. I keep thinking about killing myself and wishing I could die in an accident or just be erased from existence. 

I wish I could pass on my life to someone here, someone who could get better if they had meds and an okay life. I know so many people who are struggling because of mental health issues or a bad family situation but are so amazing and creative and kind. They care so much and have so much to give the world but they’re stuck with unmediated ADHD or depression or trauma while I waste my life despite having everything going for me.",parsley_and_thyme,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tujx9c/why_am_i_so_worthless/

Sleep changes nothing,"This is at no fault of the wonderful people who spoke to me last night, but nothing changes and nothing gets better.

I have a psychiatric appointment tomorrow and am thinking of asking them to put me into respite care, which is like a chill residential mental health monitoring center here in New Zealand, but I genuinely don’t know how I’m going to make it through until then without doing something awful. I just want to scream and hit myself and starve until I’m tired enough to end it.

There is literally no one I can turn to for help with this, and the work I would have to do to get my friends, family, and partner to trust me again seems so impossible when I’m this hell-bent on dying, but I feel like I need them (my partner especially) to break out of this spiral. I can’t do this alone and I need the people who genuinely love me, not nurses or therapists.

Letting friends go,"Let a friend go a few weeks ago and I doubt it's impacted her at all. It's been hard for me but a long time coming. 

When I lived overseas, I finally felt like I belonged with people. But rn I'm just lost and feeling so worthless. I can't figure out the trick to making a friend who genuinely enjoys my company as much as I enjoy theirs. I've made so many personal rules to ensure I'm approachable and supportive, not clingy etc. but they just lose interest. It's despairingly lonely. What is the literal point if you don't feel like you belong.

I've been to this overseas friend's gigs and supported her. She's always stood me up for mine, only to send apologies hours after the fact. I've remembered her birthdays and done thoughtful things to celebrate them. For my last birthday I said I'd wanted to video chat, but that came and went. I've been the one initiating conversations and following up on things to do together, otherwise they'd never manifest.

Now that i can travel internationally, i was broaching the subject of meeting to do something because it's been years. Not even a tangible response nope ok haha

Final straw was when a mutual friend of ours suicided. I asked about funeral/memorial arrangements and she told me she would keep me updated bc she was closer with the family (both are friends from the same country). Out of the blue a week later, she told me how nice the streamed funeral was. I was so upset. You can forget my birthday and whatever idc, but how could you possibly forget this one really, really obviously important thing that matters?

Then it was just radio silence from her until i made conversation again and business as usual. But something had snapped. I'm still reeling about the mutual friend. Ugh. It's just so so fucked. feeling super low ever since without closure. It's fucked and feels like falling.

Eventually, 2 weeks ago i said look I'm going to leave this here, i don't want to be seen as a chore. A couple of frog memes per week unless just ain't it.

Yes it's been incredibly tough recently but damn she'd been tapering contact to ghosting on for close to a year. Looking back, I doubt she was ever actually interested in me besides sex (i do not like sex). 

I only have a few friends whom i really invest in so it feels like my world has shrunk by half.

 I had planned to move closer to my friends but I don't know what's in my future anymore. 

One friend is dead, another can't be bothered to acknowledge me.

I'm trying.,"I don't know where to start. I've struggled with anxiety and depression for so long now. I'm just tired of hurting.

I feel lonely all the time. I was raised in a cult that made me dependent on a god and community that I no longer believe in. I've only ever been in one real relationship. Every other woman I've dated either ghosted me or left me for someone else. My only sexual experience was being assaulted when I was sixteen. 

I suffer from panic attacks multiple times a day. Sometimes they're triggered, and other times they just happen. I was in a gas station yesterday, and I just started shaking and hyperventilating to the point I nearly passed out. It feels like my default emotions are either sadness or panic now. 

The happiest I've been was with my ex. She was a wonderful person, and I very much wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. She made me feel very safe, and I was happy with her. She has two wonderful children that I loved very much, and they loved me too. 

I don't know why she left. She said it was because she needed time to work on herself, but her new boyfriend sent me pictures of them together. It hurt so much seeing her with someone else. She broke up with him after that.

We've been apart for almost two years now. It hurts so much not having her in my life. I've been to therapy. I'm on medication. I've been on other dates, but they don't ever go anywhere. I'm not sure what's wrong with me. The most I've gotten is that they just didn't feel any chemistry. 

I do have friends, but that's not the same. I want someone to hold and share my life with. There are so many things I used to enjoy that just feel stale and empty now. I don't enjoy life anymore. 

I want it to stop, but I don't want to hurt my parents or the friends I do have. I want to be over my ex, but it's been so long that I don't know if that's possible. I've been miserable most of my life; just surviving day-to-day.  Being with her and her children has been the only bright spot in my life. 

I don't know what to do now. I'm just tired of hurting.",rooroo999,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tur188/im_trying/

"It would appear by all measures that I am actually, well and truly, done with this thing called life, one way or another.","For the last year, I have slowly watched my job search wane and turn to ritualized self-pitying. From LinkedIn applications to LinkedIn stalking to LinkedIn browsing the news feed to LinkedIn on the other tab to LinkedIn never being opened. Eventually I came to face that I don't even want to work again anymore, I'm tired of giving myself hope and then messing everything up for myself.

For the last month, I have sat staring at a panoply of methods available to me and been unable to bring myself to do it. I'm not going to pretend I have the unique insight or motivation worthy of a long, castigating letter aimed at society, or the culture, gods or God. I have done a couple neat things in my life, but most were the result of a sort of messy, fluid, spontaneous manipulation of reality; i.e. applying endless causality and regression to behaviors that were ultimately mere impulses. Pretending I wasn't let go for having a nervous breakdown led to my first job in management, for example. Lying about deaths in the family barely carried me through my undergraduate education. Just a long line of borderline psychopathic behavior, designed to minimize my accountability or the work I did. I'm not a psychopath, but I am probably a borderline. A deeply self-aware one, but the insight provides no safeguard against the illness, in fact, if anything, it enhances the pain.

The local hospitals seem to take a step further, calling it ""personality disorder unspecified"" and alluding to narcissistic traits that make me unsuitable for hospitalization or comprehensive care. And so they will not admit me to the adult psychiatry ward any longer, which is more than a bit of a blessing, given my past experience with the police and an unwarranted attempt to involuntarily hospitalize me. My last discharge summary accuses me of engaging in this behavior mostly for attention or to gain some kind of secondary benefit (I think they mean housing, though this is quite far fetched as I'm not homeless.)

To some degree, especially in the past, they may have been correct. But really its just pain avoidance. I can't bring myself to endure the pain. But I found a solution. I just sat down. And I'm going to remain seated until the police drag me out of my apartment and the street does the job for me. I don't have to kill myself, I can just... stop.

So more than anything this is just me trying to find an appropriate place to scream into the void, ""You win."" The kids who bullied me, the parents who abused me, the siblings who molested me, the doctors that told me I didn't want help the one time I honestly sought it out in earnest, the managers that manipulated my workload to be unbearable because they didn't like me personally, the former boss hounding my career and ensuring I couldn't find any work elsewhere in my industry, the ex who moved me across the country and immediately left me for her boss. You all win. I get it. I'm the patsy. I'm the loser. I'm the heavy. It's the role I was cast in and it's who I'll always be: A guy looking for the family he never had, giving everything away in the hopes someone else needs the same, and will give in return; instead finding that most people are really only interested in 1. looking out for themselves and 2. doing whatever it takes to drown out that fact and cover it up with delusions of good intentions.

I'm not looking for sympathy, or anyone to mourn me. There's nobody in my life anymore, after all of my repeatedly failings and public humiliations, not to mention the bridges I burnt with my own idiotic, short-sighted self-interest. And I'm apparently a narcissistic borderline anyway, so this is a good one for the team, the way I see it. I just, I don't know, maybe a small part of me hopes beyond hope for a rescuer, but the bigger part of me knows that's just another part of the pattern. Leave me here, let me float, I'll be under soon. Thank God that all I have to do is nothing. I was really worried when I couldn't get the knife into my skin that I was actually just doing it for attention. But no, it's just the pain. I can sit here and wait to starve or freeze.

World is crashing down,"My pet axolotl got injured recently and people online had told me to put him down. I didnt do it, and he has improved alot, but he hasnt been eating and Im really nervous. He doesnt seem happy anymore and its stressful. 

Im not diagnosed with autism or OCD, but I show lots of severe symptoms of both disorders. A few nights ago my brother was sitting on my bed, and tying his shoes. While I love my brother, he was leaning over on my bed, causing the matress to shift and the sheet to peel up from underneath the matress and come undone. This may seem like something of a minor inconvience, but for me it sent me into a terrible, rage filled ""tantrum"". It gets hard to controll myself when small things like that happen. Im too old to still be acting like a child and throwing ""tantrums"" over stuff like this. My mom yelled at me after I shouted at my brother, and that sent me into a panic attack. Ive been terribly anxious and suicidal as of late. I feel like I cant stop making people angry.

Ive been trying to take care of myself using spiritual health, but I just keep backtracking. Ive been happy for the past two or three days, but it feels like a Manic-type happy. Im too young to be diagnosed with Bipolar, but due to my many hospitilizations for bipolar traits, Im on watch for the disorder until I turn 18. Im so anxious and frustrated with the manic-type mood becuase Im scared its going to end and ill fall deeper into my suicidal thoughts.

I can't even take the leap,"I can't commit suicide.

I've a dedicated boyfriend, the most loyal and loving brothers and a wonderful work team. If I take that dive off the 49th level of the building that a couple of good mates showed me for my surefire death, I'd really be a selfish jerk. I'll go in headfirst, and everything will be forgotten: my roles, my responsibilities, and the tremendous pain I've caused to my loved ones. I can finally sleep in peace for longer than eight hours, my head will stop hurting - and I will stop hurting others and myself. 

I'm afraid of the pain of suicide. Most of all, I hate to imagine the pain it will bring to all of them, because the brief pain of hitting concrete is not as bad as a lifetime of being a total wreck to others. All I can be capable of is worsening things and being absolutely selfish, so actually, it's rather fitting if I take that dive, wouldn't it? But I can't. I can't do this. 

I keep fantasizing it, from since I was young. I was fated to be little miss villain for the lives of many, apparently. In many parts of my life, I switched between being the laughingstock or the punching bag. All my good deeds goes unseen; all my small mistakes, scrutinized, and became a piece of evidence of how I was doomed a fool. I'm a caricature of all horrible women to my father and boyfriend, who only has an abusive mother for a parent, and my father, who parted ways with my unhinged mother.

Everything I did for my family pales to my brother because he's more charming and good-looking, even though he's done nastier things and thrown bigger tantrums. My accomplishments and achievements, dismissed in a flash. Do more of this and that - but he gets a congratulations. I get told to do more for my family.

I took all their blunders and insults, forgave and forgotten it - but mine isn't. Any show of pain and I'm selfish.

Everything I do ends up being ""selfish"" in some way.

I can't rewind or take the things I did back. I don't like playing the conceited asshat, at all. Please, God, help me. Someone just talk to me and help me believe there is hope. Please tell me why suicide isn't the answer.

Come laugh at my ridiculous suicide attemps,"Over the past 6 years, I've attempted suicide 4 times. 

First time, in 2016, I opened up my wrists the wrong way. I just ended up needing stitches and just passing out. Way to go. 
Second time, 2021: I tried to hang, but my belt broke lmao.
Third time, 2021: tried to strangle myself with a belt to pass out and choke. Ex boyfriend found me after 15 minutes. No death + I've likely traumatised a normal guy.
Fourth time, 2022: took a LOT of pills (a bit of everything) and ended up needing to call A&amp;E cos the pain was too much lol.

How do I go from here?,"This may be the wrong place to post this, because at least, at this moment, I don't want to commit suicide, but I'm afraid it may be coming.

I used to be outgoing. I used to be an overwhelmingly positive person. I used to have control over my emotions.

Then came the abuse. I met the love of my life. An absolutely wonderful person. But her mother was horrifically mentally abusive, and abused the hell out of me as well. Whenever her mother was somehow ""out of reach"", things almost always went much better. But gaslighting is a hell of a drug, I even thought I had severe memory issues for a while. Eventually I slowly started realizing what was going on. But that's when her mother made all the seeds of doubt she planted sprout. She brainwashed her into thinking I was always trying to bring her down, that I cheated on her, that I did so many horrible things to her, when in fact, it was the opposite. I mean, there are some cases where I'm pretty sure her mother did things to her that are borderline sexual assault. It makes me feel completely sick to think about it, but then, she had no problem sexually harassing me, so it's not that much of a stretch.

I attempted suicide. After a good friend of mine convinced me to go to the emergency center of my local hospital and I was sent home with medication. After I was literally just about paralyzed by my mental state (I couldn't even stand, never mind walk) and called the health hotline, asking them to bring me to the hospital, and two nurses came and sent me to bed with medication. Only after the attempt did I land in the mental ward. But they barely had any therapy (usually max an hour a day), I had no privacy, it sometimes felt like some of the staff were gaslighting me, and when all that made the situation worse they wanted to put me on antidepressants, with statements that directly contradicted what was on the patient information paper I was supposed to sign. I refused. Had they tried proper therapy and that had not been enough, I would have taken the antidepressants. But they didn't, until the ward's psychologist finally convinced the head doctor that I be transferred to an inpatient clinic, where I got the therapy I needed, and suddenly, things got a lot better without antidepressants. Until the head doctor decided I had had enough inpatient treatment and pretty much kicked me out, despite the opinions of the therapists and the psychologist there. I was supposed to continue with psychological rehab, but the paperwork got more and more, and in the last months it got too much, I just can't do it anymore.

One of the things that I was always told in the psychiatry was that we were supposed to make connections to other patients there to help each other. Part of me thinks it was a cop out for them, but I did it. Specifically one woman, who I got along with really well. She was still being actively mentally abused by her then partner and father of her daughter. We got along with each other really well and helped each other a lot, because of our similar experiences.

But the system failed her, too. She went into the psychological rehab and came out worse then before, and after a half a dozen suicide attempts finally landed in the psych ward. Where it was almost the same story, with a head doctor who was a downright narcissist as far as I can tell, who kicked her out when she contracted Covid. I offered her to stay at my place, and we've been helping each other out, but I think she's getting feelings for me.

And it's not much better with her daughter. I talked with one of the people from CPS, it the person there just doesn't understand that this is abuse. No matter what I say, no matter what she says, it doesn't get through her thick skull. She treats it all as ""disagreements"".

As to a relationship with her: It's just I can't. I'm so fucked up from what happened during my previous relationship, I'm not ready for it, and she knows it. She's still living here, because if she leaves here, it's back to her abusive ex, and back to square one.

And then last night we watched the show ""For Life"", which really fucked me up. Specifically the part where it's revealed that the daughter gave up on her plans for studying where she wanted to... I just couldn't. I had to think back to my ex, who is practically jailed at her mother's place, but ""only"" with psychological methods, and gave up on all her dreams. She also wanted to study. She wanted to work in the OR. That was her life's dream. And she definitely didn't lack the intelligence or the perseverance. And I had to think back at that. It hurts.

I need some sort of mental help, and my friend who's staying here needs it too. But the system has failed both of us. She's more suicidal than I am, but I would be lying if the thought hadn't crossed my mind that we should commit suicide together, because that would make a serious statement.

I'm lying in bed on my computer, she's in the next room listening to music, sobbing every once in a while. I can't do much, and I don't know what to do any more. There's so much I have to do, but I just can't. I've tried just about every office where you're supposed to get help in this regard, without much success. And I'd rather die than to go to a psych ward again where you're placed in a bedroom with a total stranger.

Fear of death,"I kind of tried to kill myself when I was little, i was so depressed and in pain i didn't fear death,

Now I'm an adult with an objectively even worse life, things are looking more hopeless by the day with all my illnesses getting worse.

But now I am fearful, i fear death and nothingness, even tough i literally cry and hurt myself badly every single day since 7 months ago.

How does one get rid of the instinct to survive, when it is literally painful to do so?

My last week on earth,"Tomorrow is the day I finally end this journey,,I’ve been a shell of myself since my mom passed away 6 years ago,,, I’ve had a few attempts since then that landed me in the psych ward,, the meds? They don’t work,,, the things that used to make me happy? They no longer do,, most of my friends abandoned me over some bullshit that wasn’t even my fault 


So I finally decided that it’s my time,, this past week I listened to all the music that I’ve enjoyed over the years,, I went to see one of my favorite EDM artists,, I hung out and reconnected with a close friend that I hadn’t seen since the beginning of Covid,, and I took Acid and watched the most beautiful sunset I’ve ever seen,,


I don’t know any of you,, but we’re all connected through our mutual struggle,, I wish you all the best and I honestly hope that you find something worth living for,, but for me,, this is the end of the line

Life is just too much,"At the moment, I don't brush my teeth most days, and the days I do, I only do it at night. I can't remember the last time I had a shower (I clean myself sometimes with baby wipes). My parents make sure I eat, if they didn't I probably wouldn't.

From what I gather of how people go about life, the bare minimum seems to be to brush your teeth twice a day, shower every day, make your own food, do your own laundry, do your own washing up, get a job, deal with people, and probably more that I've forgotten, though people's idiosyncratic circumstances and stuff result in different experiences.

The bare minimum is too much for me. It's too hard and completely unenjoyable, and I can't say I have any desire to go through it. To be honest, I don't seem to have any desire for anything anymore, just fog and numbness.

I can't even seem to muster the energy to try anymore. Surely all the therapies and medications we've tried, something should have helped by now, so all I can think is that it's down to me not trying hard enough or not being strong enough.

It seems like there's only one solution, but even that would probably just ruin my family's lives even more than I already do. Seems I just don't have what it takes to get through life.",SmeethGoder,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tu10jr/life_is_just_too_much/

Mentally struggling,"Escapism is my main form of coping with suicidal thoughts. Whether it’s through interacting with family members, watching youtube videos, playing video games,  or eating junk food, escapism has always been the main way I have coped. Running away from my problems is the only thing I know.

I am a coward. I have never faced any of my mental health issues head on. I don’t have enough money to afford seeking medical help. If I did, I would have done so a long time ago.

My current goals in life include finding a stable career, a serious relationship, and achieving long term happiness. To achieve these goals, I know that I must fix myself mentally. I want to visit a therapist, but I don’t want it to show up on my parents’ health insurance. If I end up being lucky enough to land a stable, decent paying career by the time I turn 25, I plan on seeking medical attention if I don’t happen to kill myself by then.

My parents aren’t the type to believe in therapy and mental health assistance despite both of them having experience in healthcare. I don’t want anyone in my family to know about this and I don’t want to cause drama within the only group of people I have in my life.

My friends have been busy making progress in their own lives. They have made many new friends and are seemingly succeeding in life. Most of them are graduating college this year. My siblings are graduating this year as well. I have only completed the first 2 years of college. I feel so lost and directionless in life. I have no idea what career to pursue. I am currently in a dead end, overnight manual labor warehouse job making very little money. Everyone is progressing far ahead of me. Soon enough I will be abandoned and forgotten. Everyone I know will eventually become too busy with their own lives and I will be left alone to kill myself. 

Suicidal thoughts have plagued my mind since I was 14 years old. I am 22 now. It’s becoming more difficult to escape my suicidal thoughts as more years pass. I am afraid that I will soon hit a breaking point and eventually end my life. It feels like a paradox. Deep down, I don’t really want to kill myself. It’s as if my brain is poisoned and it’s trying to convince me that killing myself is a solution to everything. 

I have lost so many hours of sleep due to my own mind. Currently losing more sleep as I am typing this at around 5:30 AM.

I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I legitimately don’t see a future for myself other than suicide.",TooMuchMelancholy,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tuftgl/mentally_struggling/
Nothing to look forward to except my death,"People tell us to live for x except we don't have anything to live for. Telling us that suicide is a permanent solution to temporary struggles is bullshit. We will ALWAYS struggle, although the kind of struggles we have may change from time to time. And so what if it's permanent? Once we end our lives then we won't have any problems to worry about right? Then what's the point? Oh, our loved ones will suffer? Well, that is if we even have any. I am lucky to have a few people, but I still disagree. Sure, they'll grieve for a while, but they're all better off without me anyway. So what's the point? There is NO point. If you have found reasons to live, great and I hope you keep finding reasons to. But just because you have found reasons, doesn't mean the rest of us have. Since whoever is above isn't killing me anytime soon, I should stop delaying the inevitable. The sooner the better. Give me the courage to actually do it, instead of just staring at the wall like a damn fool. I really don't get why many people still choose to live on despite everything that's going on.

I guess a part of me is wishing I didn't have to die. Honestly if there were a way to stabilize I would. But there seems to be no way to avoid it. I really what else to do. I haven't been able to even get my pills. I'm trapped in my house. I'll die in my house. I already set up a cord around my ceiling fan. I look at it everyday trying to psych myself up into it. There were times when i felt this way but there was a option out. A way to stop myself from falling. And now there's nothing I can do. I came so close to getting my car back and then the bank was like nuh. We are gonna place a week+ hold on this check you cashed. And then Monday came and went. A week went by. Two weeks... I just feel so much shame i cant talk to anyone. I cant fix this. Without my car i cant go get a job. I cant do anything so its like :/ If only they would have found another option. If only I didn't live HERE.

Lately i've been watching this youtuber turned mass shooter known as Randy Stair. He contemplated suicide for a couple years before actually doing it. He uh is a bit of a inspiration. I don't want to hurt people. But i can in some ways connect to how he felt. How miserable he was, because he dealt with gender identity issues. And while I've transitioned. Its still hard. I still feel incomplete. Especially since I haven't had in estradiol in 2 weeks. I feel like my body is becoming less my own again. I'm scared. I'm alone. No one talks to me anymore. I've withdrawn. I don't know what to do. If i had my car i would have at least had the ability to run. But now i cant even do that. I'm terrified. At the same time maybe this is for the best. To die young. I'm super vain about my appearance so lol.. And i somehow managed to avoid any signs of aging at 34. But whatever... Iunno. I really wish this didn't happen. But its been a downward spiral since August. Even when I found some lift.

Its unfortunate there's no real help available when facing complete financial collapse. I'm not a drug addict. I'm not crazy. I do have interpersonal issues. I have problems dealing with people, and have problems with criticism and authority and that is what usually leads to me losing jobs. But i'm smart. And when i have the means I can take care of myself. I made it this far all alone... So why. Why couldnt I ever get just a LITTLE help. Just a little..

Two months to ruin my entire life. Thats all it took. Two months of finicial instability made me lose everything. That's how it goes. I'm completely unable to do anything about it. And i just wake up with zero motivation. It hurts so much to think about. I cant handle the stress so i'm just avoiding it.

I can't go homeless. I'm a transwoman, nothing good will come of that.

I'd rather die on my own terms then on some dirty street.

I probably shouldn’t worry so much, I don’t have any kind of impact on the people actually in my life so I doubt it would overly effect a stranger. But I wish it would just happen accidentally - like a car accident, drowning, etc. - so that it wouldn’t be so obvious I wanted to die.

I messed up.,"24/M. I have been struggling with anger issues since I was a child. And I never really got any help for it. 
I bury things deep within because I’m too scared that a confrontation will trigger an angry outburst. And then it builds up to a point where a seemingly small incident will cause me to lose control.
When I do lose control, I say horrible things - about people, about the things they care about, about thoughts and insecurities they shared with me when they were vulnerable. 
In that moment, even if I know that if I were calmer, I would be able to get my point across better, it doesn’t matter. And when other people try to soothe me, it only gets worse.

This morning, I had a major fight with my roommate - over something very trivial. I completely lost control. I don’t think there’s any coming back from the kind of things I said. We are both doctors and we have known each other since med school. And this was our last month together before we went our own ways.

Suffering for my kids…,"🚨TW: abuse, sexual assault, domestic violence, and obviously suicide🚨

If life was a card game, I’ve been dealt a really shitty hand. Of course there’s always going to be someone that has it worse than me, but it feels as if life has never given me a break.

I don’t really know when it started. Probably when I was really young. But for as long as I can remember, there’s always been something to go monumentally wrong. My mom was diagnosed with cancer and died when I was 11. I had to them live with my alcoholic father. The same year my mother died, our house burned down and we lost almost everything. We were homeless for a few months, then when we finally settled into our own place and it seemed like things were going to get better, my dad went to jail for CSC charges. He was gone for 7 months, but in that time I had to live with his sister who was a strict Christian woman. I already had religious trauma then this woman made sure to make my life a living hell. I rebelled against her so much that she pretty much gave up on me and when my dad was released, he was forced to take me back. 

Not long after I turned 15, I met a guy that I thought I really liked. I probably only started dating him because he was 19 and I knew my dad would hate him. Well, jokes on me because not long into our relationship, he got me drunk and r*ped me. I broke up with him and he started stalking me. But that ended when he was arrested for vandalizing a cemetery. I had fallen behind in school already so I decided to start attending an alternative ed school. That’s where I met my daughters father. We met in September when school started, started dating in October, then I got pregnant in early February. The relationship didn’t last long because I found out he was cheating on me with his cousin’s wife. Then I found out that he had been arrested for sexual assault. He was bailed out just in time for me to give birth. He was only out for about a month when he had to go to court for sentencing. It’s been 7 years since. 

The relationship after that kind of snuck up on me. I wasn’t expecting to fall for someone. But along came my son’s father. We met in July of 2015, and dated of and on for almost 6 years. It was the longest relationship I’d been in. But the reason we were off and on so much is because we fought a lot. It started small but then it went from screaming matches, to punching holes in the walls, then eventually he started taking my phone from me and hiding it or locking it up. My son came in July of 2017. His dad and I weren’t together at the time and I was staying with a friend in their basement. I felt like such a burden because they had six kids of their own. Three of which were adopted and had serious trauma/development issues. So until May of 2021, I went back to my ex. The final straw was drawn after he physically restrained me to take my phone again and when I recovered it and tried to leave, he locked me in a bedroom and left with my kids. 

For almost the entirety of 2021, I was homeless. My kids and I stayed in a domestic violence shelter for a good chunk of that time. Mentally, I was fried. After an incident with my son and another kid at the shelter, we had to leave. But with nowhere to go, I had to make the extremely hard decision to split my family up. My son went to his dads, my daughter went to my friends, and I ended up sleeping in the back of my dads SUV for a few weeks. Well, word got out to my dads landlord and he didn’t like that idea so much and told my dad and I that I had to find somewhere else to stay by September 1st. Of course I couldn’t so I ended up checking myself in to the hospital for suicidal ideation. I was there for almost 2 weeks and when I was released, I ended up staying solo at a YWCA. That’s when I got the good news from the apartment complex I had applied to back in May. A unit had opened up and would be available by October 1st. 

After that it was pretty much smooth sailing. Nothing monumental happened. I did get my heart crushed by a guy that I thought loved me. Still hurts because I still love and care about him. But we don’t talk anymore. Probably for the best. But now I’m looking at trying to get full custody of my son because he’s supposed to start kindergarten this year and obviously his father and I don’t see eye to eye. We’re also going through the process of getting him diagnosed with autism. Overall, I’m lost, I’m scared, and there’s so much hurt in my heart from all the shit that’s happened. I’m working with my doctor and a therapist to try and get my depression and anxiety under control but it’s just not working. 

My kids are the only things holding me to this earth because without me here, I know they would be neglected and they would feel just as lost as I do right now. So as much as I would love to end this pain and just release myself from this world, I can’t because my babies are more important than I am.",Kaiou_Michiru,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tu8xwd/suffering_for_my_kids/

I've still got a hangman's knot ready to go so all I need to do is tie down to something, put it over my doorframe and drop when my neck is in it because I'm afraid that the pain will be to much and I'll get cold feet and stop myself before it's over. I don't fear death at all. I haven't been afraid of dying for a while and whatever punishment I get in whatever afterlife I end up in is fine, I've come to terms with the fact that there isn't a version of heaven that a useless loser like me deserves to have. But I'm so afraid that I'll live and then everyone will be judging me for how I couldn't even kill myself right. I'm trying to save up for a gun now so I can do it properly and ensure my death with the maximum lethality possible.

One of my best friends tried to commit,"TW — Suicide

Yesterday, one of my best friends tried to commit suicide. Before i explain, i want to mention that i’m in a friend group and each one of them are my best friends. The day before yesterday, around 9pm, she texted goodbyes to all of us. We didn’t realize she did until the morning when we saw that we all got goodbye messages. She then texted one of my other best friends saying it didn’t work and that she still has to come to school.  She came about 30 minutes late and she was crying a bit and just seemed fragile. The day went on and i asked her if she was okay multiple times to which she just replied to with “i’m fine.” lunch time was over and we were supposed to go back to class and i was about to start going back when i felt her fall on my arm and she was saying my name faintly. She was collapsing. I was so fucking scared and i tried to get her up and another girl came and helped me. I then called over one of my other best friends (the girl she texted it didn’t work to) and i got her up and i had to hold her up with the help of the other girl. When she was up, she was wobbling and stumbling and i knew she had tried to khs. I told her she had to go to the office and to the hospital but she kept saying no. Our home room teacher said we should all go to the washroom and that’s when she told me and my other best friend (The one she texted) that she had tried to commit. She also told us what she took. We told her she had to get help. She then proceeded to say no and that her parents would kill her and some other shit. She then said what broke me. That she wasn’t supposed to wake up and that she wasn’t supposed to have come to school today. I was just like oh my god. We went back to the classroom where the teacher called us three to a separate room. She explained that her bf had broke up with her and she was worried that he was going to kill himself and that why she fainted. Cause she was worried. She didn’t even mention that SHE HAD TRIED TO KILL HERSELF. The teacher then left us to talk. We told her she had to tell him or we would but she made us promise not to say anything. I honestly don’t know what to do… me and the girl (the one she texted) are the only ones who know and she made us promise not ti say anything. Everyone just thinks she fainted cause she was stressed.

You'll only have a few hours to yourself each day.  I want kids but there's no point in having them if I'll never have time to watch them grow up.  People say we have a choice.  What choice?  Choosing between wasting your life or starving?  My dreams are crushed.  I live in the constant aftermath of financial trauma and I don't believe I'll ever be okay mentally because of it.  Money controls EVERYTHING.  We have no choice.  Every minor inconvenience can lead to financial ruin.  Flat tire?  Welp.  Can't afford a new one.  Now you can't get to work.  Oh and your car insurance will go up.  Shitty mattress?  Can't afford a better one?  Have fun spending 10000 dollars on back surgery in a few years.  We have no choice.",jellybeanzxx9,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tu1xgg/is_this_really_it/

I’m tired.,"I’m so exhausted from being stretched too far. I’m absolutely exhausted, lost, bitter, and done.

I’ve always known that my life wasn’t normal or easy. I feel like my traumas just keep stacking. The more that happens, the more I feel like I’m out of time, energy, and good choices.

Some highlights:

Childhood:
- 1995: literally had invasive surgeries that left me with giant scars the day I was born. My stomach has a huge scar that looks kind of like a c-section. It was a lifesaving surgery.
- 2001: first time I was told by a teacher (at my private Christian school) that the doctor who performed my surgery was going to hell for playing God.

High school:
- 2011: lost my childhood home because my parents didn’t pay their taxes during the recession. This would also prevent me from getting student loans and financial aide in college.
- 2012: my high school boyfriend committed suicide after years of drug use. He was a lifelong best friend as well. My parents hated him because they were so unbelievably racist. I see now that he was a child crying for help. At the time, he was my boyfriend and also an abuser. He frequently assaulted me. I recently mourned the 10-year anniversary of his death alone in a hotel room because my husband *had* to have me tag along for a convention he was attending. (I couldn’t attend the convention though.)
- 2013: my dad had a mental break and tried to kill me with a gun. The police were called but ultimately left without doing anything.

College:
- 2013: my dad was diagnosed with terminal kidney failure. He neglected his health and it caught up to him.
- 2013: I was drugged and raped at a party. Rape kit testing showed DNA of multiple people.
- 2014: I lived in poverty with multiple maxed out credit cards to pay for tuition. I literally ate saltine crackers and peanut butter for all of my meals.
- 2014: a coworker from my part time job got my address from our manager. He came to my apartment in the middle of the night. I thought it was my boyfriend when I answered the door. He came in and pinned me down. Luckily, he just drunkenly slobbered on my face.
- 2015: my boyfriend wanted to have sex without a condom. I got pregnant. I paid for my abortion on my own. He hung out with his friends instead.
- 2015: I had to take a year off school because I was so broke. I had straight A’s. I spent the next year having every adult (outside of my immediate family) in my life call me a dropout.
- 2015: my dad got a lot more sick. He often forgot who we were. He spent a significant amount of time in the hospital.
- 2016: went back to school for my senior year. I was supposed to live in my boyfriend’s parent’s basement. However, when they went away for a weekend trip they asked my boyfriend and I to watch over their 16yo son. He ended up buying beer that I poured out. Apparently, that was unacceptable because it made him “uncomfortable”. I moved into a tiny studio with my boyfriend.
- 2016: aforementioned boyfriend started a troubling habit of gaslighting.
- 2017: got engaged and set the date for my wedding. My fiancé lied and didn’t check the date with his family. We ended up getting married on his grandfather’s birthday. I found out at our graduation dinner and spontaneously sobbed in front of both of our families.
- 2017: I gave up what I wanted for my fiancé’s career. I gave up my family business so he could get a good entry level data analyst position. The caused a big rift in my family life and my career. To make ends meet and pay for our wedding, I took on two jobs and a lot of date night babysitting. I worked 60 hour weeks for 3 years.
- 2018: generally terrible work life balance from those 60 hour weeks. Also took on all of the housework and pet care.
- 2019: infertility. Despite trying for kids, I just couldn’t get pregnant. I succeeded in November 2019 and miscarried. We bought a house though. That was my highlight.
- 2020: my dad died at the beginning of the pandemic. No funeral. It was terrible. I had been preparing for my dad to die for 5 years and I didn’t even get to mourn. Nannying made my miscarriages and infertility worse. Everything compacted and I ended up doing a total career shift. I became an administrative manager at an e-commerce company. I loved it. It was high stress, but it was amazing. I quickly built up a group of direct reports and was promoted. Downside: almost no PTO. It drove my husband insane.
- Oct 2021: my husband encouraged me to leave behind my job and pursue risky startups—definitely what I wanted. He made enough money for me to do so.
- Nov 2021: my husband came out as trans. Total blindside. He did it less than a week after I left my job. I also miscarried. He did it in an incredibly manipulative and cruel way. He told friends within 12 hours and had a tiny army against me in rapid speed. My chances of having kids now? None. My sexual attraction to women? Also none. He insisted on an open relationship because he can’t take it if sex is off the table.
- Dec 2021: I started filing for divorce. My husband begged me to stop so I did. He promised to not transition.
- Jan 2022-present: daily fights. He is transitioning and I am financially stuck. I have no future with him and I am not going to just start over. He knew for YEARS and hid it from me. No one cares. He doesn’t care. No one does.

Today:
Tomorrow is the 2-year anniversary of my dad’s death. He was 66 when he died. I was 24. We only had 6-months to repair our relationship in 2013 before he was too sick. I watched him die from afar for 5 years.

Since April 2, 2020, I have had 6 miscarriages and my husband came out as trans. I don’t have a reliable career because I left the job I had when my husband asked me to.

I kept track of the days I felt suicidal. I agreed that once I hit 30 in a row, I would just do it. I hit 30. So what’s the point?? Literally. What is the point? What am I fighting for to stay alive? I’m alone. I’m depressed. I’m literally collateral damage in my husband’s transition.

"I don’t wanna die, I just don’t wanna be a nobody with everyone faking it or hating me.","I sometimes sh. I hate getting crushes cause I always break. Now that I’m 18 my feelings are wayyyy deeper and a bit more realistic than the ones at age 13. I finally made a friend. She’s a great friend. I just happen to have a crush on her. Hearing her talk about dating app stuff crushes me. I know I don’t deserve her and i am too much. I want her to be happy so I’m never gonna tell her. Fuck feelings, man. Being gay is fucking hard. And I can’t control it. Let’s see… what else? Oh my therapist got on the phone with another “client” during our zoom call for 10 minutes of our thirty minute session which she always comes late to. I had intrusive thoughts like sl1tt1ng my throat on camera just so she’d freak out and drop the phone. But I don’t wanna die. I just wanna disappear for a while and watch people be happy and live the life that I can’t have ever. I know that I will never have love or anything of that sort. I probably overwhelm my crush/ friend. Even tho we’re close, I know I’m exhausting. I’m a waste of space. My mom is angry cause I didn’t get a job I applied to. I’m a failure. For now I’m just gonna sh and  try to drown in my sleep. NO ONE CARES. I DONT FUCKING MATTER SO I NEED PEOPLE TO STOP BATTING THEIR EYES WITH “Yes you do.

I HAVE to do it.. eventually,"Hi, so I am 18 years old and currently attending college. I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was about 12 years old. They never seem to completely go away. I’m on 40mg of Prozac. In my teen years I was in CPS from 15 until I turned 18. I was sexually abused at 13,14, and 15. Anyways this doesn’t matter. I’ve also kinda attempted suicide. But anyways at least once a month or so I break down crying and resorting back to wanting to end my life. Of course right now I’m currently stressed with college, trying to find a place to live, find a job, and much more but at the end of the day I feel like what is the point. I look up to people who found the strength to end their own lives, I’m terrified and I’m lazy. I just want it over with. Last night I had a dream about some stranger ending their own life and as they were dying I begged and pleaded for them to help me end my own life. My jealously was so strong because I wanted to be them so bad. I’ve been thinking about this dream all day. Anyways, I just want to do it so so bad. It’s my goal in life. No matter where I am, I am never happy. People point it out to, I try so hard but I’m never satisfied or content in the moment. I know I have a long life ahead of me but I seriously have no goals at all in life besides ending my life. I always vision myself to be dead. I get asked what I want to major in college but I picked general studies just so I can seem like I’m productive and wanting a future. If I could be anywhere in this world, even the most beautiful and amazing places, I don’t want to go because I’ll only enjoy it for a little bit but my mind will turn back to darkness. I love reading, writing, listening to music, but I don’t do it often. It’s boring. I’m tired of eating, sleeping, showering, going to school, and simply just waking up and breathing. I personally believe life is just not for me. I love and appreciate the people I know and the people who care about me but they will be okay. I know it will hurt them so so bad once I end my life, but I have to do this. I’m not sure when, but it’s something I know I HAVE to do.",Sabrina1377,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tu96uw/i_have_to_do_it_eventually/

Ready to give it up.,"Hi everyone, 

this is my first time posting on here and I could really use some clarity and support. 

To be honest, I contemplate suicide on an almost daily basis.  I honestly just don't see the point in living. 

I feel like everything constantly goes wrong, like one thing after another. It's a constant string of failures, an dI just don't see the point of life. 

Like nothing makes me happy, everything just stresses me out. 

I feel like I put in so much effort into friendships and I get nothing in return.  Recently I realised that i'm a back up friend, even though I put everything into the friendship. Like I feel worthless, like if I was gone no one would even notice, let alone blink to the fact.  

I've never had a boyfriend and I'm 30 years old and because of societal norms this makes me feel like i'm just not good enough for anyone. I've been on the apps to try and meet people and I used to go on a lot of dates, and I just never felt that connection, like maybe my standards were too high. 

I mean from the outside I may look accomplished, I have high academic accomplishments and athletic accomplishments that some people can only dream of. But i'm just not happy. I've never been happy.

I’m continent with the thought of dying,"I have pushed away every single friend I’ve ever had since 14 away and I haven’t made a friend since then (I’m 24) I got wrongfully accused of domestic violence at 21 and I’m still dealing with the cases. On top of that the one person I connected with and dated for 2 years recently tried to take my dog from me that I raised from birth &amp; she got him along with everything I worked for. Apartment, all property, my dog, it’s all been taken away. I stood in front of her with my hands behind my back as she shoved me, called the cops and ended up getting arrested. Now I have an assault charge which will make me face 3 years in jail for things I never committed. I have absolutely nobody to talk to, no social media, no friends and no money to seek help from any professional. While I was in jail for a day I read a book about death &amp; I’ve come to the realization I’m completely ready to die. It doesn’t scare me or make me feel nervous thinking about moving on to whatever is next in this journey away from this life. I have all the resources to do so but I don’t want to suffer I want to go peacefully. I have $0 in my bank account, no job, no car, my high school sister has more then I ever see myself having in the future. I don’t ever want to do anything I once loved doing, I find no joy in even looking at myself in the mirror. I’m completely lost.

I do have two amazing people in my life who believe me and have tried to support me as best as they can. they haven't hurt me, and they won't. but I see the stress I cause them, the pain i add to their lives. i see how tired they've become as they try to help me and nothing continues to work. it's not fair to them for me to keep asking for their support. i don't want them to worry and suffer any more.

One More Month,"I'm giving myself until the end of April before I finally decide to end it all. 

I've set many deadlines like this before, hoping and praying for some sign of hope or relief. For some semblance that I'll find a path to feeling human or actually fitting in, but each time I'm proven wrong. 

Despite my countless efforts, counseling, medication and every piece of advice under the sun, nothing has changed and nothing ever will, I'm starting to accept that now. Perhaps my shortcomings, my failings, bad luck and just feeling worthless is a actually a sign from the universe that I was a mistake and was meant to be snuffed out.

Still I'm giving it one more month, my last ditch effort to find some purpose or excuse to breathe. I know what method I'll use, I know how I'll distant myself from my friends and loved ones and the final words I'll share with  them, for over two years I've fantasized about this.

Why haven't I done it then? Perhaps I'm just a coward who fears pain, fears failing and becoming permanently disabled. Still, living when you feel so fucking alien to the whole world hurts so much more that I know if I just toughen up and do it, I'll be better off dead and at rest.

My last rejection,"Just heard back from an application I put everything into.  The pay isn’t great, the work wasn’t satisfying, but dammit I wanted something to try and turn my life around.  That was it.  Cried so hard I vomited.  I’m sure the booze didn’t help.

My family doesn’t give a fuck.  My father walked in on me drunk, choking on my own spit, gave me the usual spiel on going outside, calling a therapist, how much this hurts him, etc.  He doesn’t really care, he just wants me gone without having to tell his friends his firstborn jumped off a bridge.

I’ll be honest, my friends have been calling me for weeks.  I’ve been depressed for a while, but they know somethings really wrong this time.  I can’t be bothered to return anything.  Some of them have given up already.  Good for them.

I don’t even talk to my mother.  Her mother (my grandma) just told us that she could die soon.  My mom wants to meet with me and talk, but I blew her off today.  I care, just not enough to override the thoughts of death.

My head aches.  I have nowhere else to go but down.  Even the clear thoughts about suicide I used to have just feel like a fuzzy mess.  I feel like I could end up at that bridge without even realizing.

I can’t do this shit anymore. I’m on the edge and I need help desperately,"I really don’t want to live anymore… nothing is ever getting better and I can’t take it anymore

For the last few years I have tried everything I can to better myself, I’ve been working on my confidence, my social skills, I’ve been working out, and I’ve been myself. But nobody wants me still. Every relationship I’ve had has failed, despite my efforts to do everything right. Everybody I’ve loved has left me without any remorse regarding it. I’m too different from everybody I meet, and nobody can handle me. I have ADHD, and I know I get very hyperactive. All I wanted to do was make others smile but it doesn’t work. No woman I’ve ever met can take being around me, they just can’t love me

All of my friends have been trying to get rid of me, nobody is there for me ever. All they have been doing is making fun of me and criticizing me. Even physically hitting me with things sometimes. Nobody calls me, nobody ever makes any plans with me. I’m just alone all day. Nowhere I go I am welcome. Not at work, not at school, nowhere

I can’t even do my job properly, and I’ve been failing school because I just can’t take it anymore. All my family ever does anymore is reinforce how disappointed they are in me, and how I won’t amount to anything in my life. Nobody ever tries to help me, nobody. And nothing I do has ever helped

Therapy doesn’t do anything. Neither does medication, nothing helps. I can’t do it anymore, I just can’t. Nobody truly loves who I am in my heart. Nobody wants my true self. I can’t hide my whole life, I can’t live like this anymore.

My friend once told me: “If a person really wanted to commit suicide they would just do it instead of talking about it all the time.”,"Is this true? 

A couple years ago my dad had recently passed away and I was starting to be a bad place again. I have suicidal thoughts most days for much of my life but it always kind of ranges between just thinking about it, casually thinking about it, forming a plan as a fantasy and sometimes more seriously. 

I guess I do sometimes talk about it a lot, which I feel guilty about, but I don’t think I’m good at keeping things in and most of the time people tell you to talk about it so you’ll feel better (but most of the time they roll their eyes at me and tell me to stop talking about it). But anyway, I was starting to feel pretty bad again so I told my friend (and at that time we were pretty close) and this was his response to me. I was pretty gutted and confronted him about it months later, which he said he didn’t remember it, laughed and said he was sorry—but it honestly still really hurt me. Like, any time I think about suicide or committing suicide, I just remember this and tell myself: “well if I was really serious about it I’d just do it.” 

I guess what I'm trying to ask is am I in the wrong or and I wrong to feel the way I do about this?",Gothamstreetcat,10,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ttv8vo/my_friend_once_told_me_if_a_person_really_wanted/

I’ve never felt more alone.,"My wife has said I’ve changed recently, been more down, more moody, not present in the relationship, but how do I tell the person I love I feel alone all the time, I feel depressed all the time. How do I tell her I have a suicide note ready and plans to end it all. I’ve always struggled with depression. 

I Tried to kill myself at 15, threw myself down a few flights of stairs. Aside from a concussion and a tonne of broken bones I survived. Told my mum I slipped. Think she knows I didn’t but never mentioned it since. 

Few years later my close friend killed herself. I never got over that. I then followed this with my second suicide attempt but my girlfriend who I later married prevented it. I tried to OD but she got to me first. Fast forward to my mid 20’s and the best friend and father figure I ever had died of cancer. I cried on my wedding day because he couldn’t be there. 

I’m twenty fucking seven and have been to 11 funerals. I’ve watched almost everyone I care about either die or move on. I think as I got older, to deal with it I started pushing people away. Now aside from my wife I have no one and even then it feels like she isn’t there.

I’m an embarrassment. I keep on failing. Anyone else in my position would be doing much better than I am.,"I’m a senior in high school. My grades have been dropping, and I’ve been attending classes less and less. It’s clear that I’m not doing well as I can and should be doing.

I was supposed to be attending a top 25 college in the US. I got a 35 on my ACT, had straight As until senior year, was in the top 10 percent of my class at an elite private high school, and I’m a National Merit Scholarship Finalist. I have more than enough intelligence and financial support to succeed.

And yet I can’t utilize my resources like my peers do. Students that are considerably worse than me academically are going to schools better than the schools I was accepted to. And students at a similar level academically are taking harder classes, getting better grades, doing more extracurriculars, and getting into the colleges I was supposed to get into. I applied to 17 schools and only got into 3. I was waitlisted at 8 schools too, which just felt like salt in the wound. The best school I got into is Colgate, and my older brother’s at the University of Chicago.

Everyone’s pitying me. It feels terrible. My mom keeps saying that “things are going to work out.” Yet she’s stressed out about my college situation, is desperately trying to use connections to get me off of waitlists at better schools, and wants me to transfer to a better school next year. My friends just say “I’m sorry.” After all, there’s nothing else they can do. But I hate them because they got into better schools than me and are better than me even though I’m supposed to be better than them. I keep on lashing out at them because blaming them allows me to feel slightly better about myself for a second. Or I just isolate myself because I can’t be happy around them right now when I’m so jealous of them. I hate myself for getting angry at them: It’s immature and stupid, and I know it, but I can’t help it.

I’m an embarrassment. Most of the other kids in my grade are going to great schools, and it’ll be terrible to tell them that I’m not. Every adult around me expected me to go to a great school, but I couldn’t do it. How do I face them? How do I keep a straight face when I tell them I’m going to a shitty college and they silently but clearly judge me? How do I cope with the fact that I let them down?

Fuck college. Fuck life. I’m so miserable. I’m a waste of space and resources. Instead of being a gifted kid with the money to be successful, I’m a mentally ill fuck-up. I’m no different than my mentally ill, fucked up dad who, just like me, was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and still managed to ruin everything.

I’m so ashamed and embarrassed and miserable. I can’t believe I let so many people down. I wish I could just die before I get any worse. I don’t want to embarrass my family any more than I already have, so I can’t kill myself. But a tragic, regular death, is exactly what I need. If I died right now, people would still think I was a decent person. Maybe I just got unlucky with colleges, or had a rough year because of Covid. There’s still some sort of excuse to maintain my façade of success. But the longer I live, the worse it gets. Eventually it will be completely obvious that I’m a mentally ill fuck-up that’s beyond repair.

If you got here, thanks for reading, and sorry you were exposed to that garbage. Not sure why I’m using this subreddit like a diary. I guess posting online anonymously is the perfect mix between a cry for help and trying to maintain my façade.

I’m an omen of bad news,"TW// ab#se

I have no friends. I have nothing. All I have is resentment, despair, mania and sadness. 

Sure, I speak to a few people online from time to time but.. friends are people you can rely on. 
I can’t rely on them.

Their blunt replies, my messages being ignored... it’s so obvious they don’t think anything of me, but as something that’ll just bring down their mood.

I can’t blame them. I never have any good news to share. 

Because my situation is inevitable. Everything is shitty, my parents, my household, my mental health, my therapy, everything. 

I don’t have anyone to talk to about anything. 

Every time I try to speak about myself they just get awkward because I never have anything good to say. But that’s because nothing good ever happens to me? 

In no way am I mad at them for that. I’d feel the same with someone else too, Because negativity can be tiring. 

I’m not trying to be negative, there just genuinely isn’t anything good going for me, and there probably won’t ever be. 

Abusive household, past s#xual and physical abuse, daily v#rbal abuse... body dysmorphia, delusions, hallucinations, mania, no sense of identity, amnesia, depression, and physical disabilities. 

Severe body dysmorphia to the point I’ll tape up mirrors in my room just so I don’t have to look at this face and body I don’t recognize. 

I hate my life, I have absolutely nothing. All I feel is misery, everything is a chore, and the most basic things a human can do is the hardest and most challenging thing for me.

I don’t even go to school because my condition is that bad, and I’m dumb and super slow in every way possible. 

Cant find any love because I always end up getting cheated on, abused or betrayed. Or I jusr self sabotage.

feel like I don't belong.,It really sucks. I don't even feel like I can post anywhere anymore. I don't feel like I can talk to anyone. Everyone has so much criticism over how I feel. No one understands but says they do and pretends they do. Just because I want to die doesn't mean I'm going to hurt myself or hurt anyone else. I just want to go. Be gone. No pain for me or anyone else. I don't want to get up. I don't want to go to work every day. I don't even want to exist. This is pointless. I keep trying to find meaning but there is none. I feel nothing regarding anything positively. I don't want to talk to anyone. I make my efforts but I don't want to. I don't want to do this anymore. It all feels so fucking pointless. Literally just living to make other people happy. I'm fucking tired. So fucking tired. I don't feel like I have a place here at all. I've tried. I've tried so fucking hard.

I want to kms,"I think about death everyday. What it would be like to be free, to stop thinking, to just be at peace. 
I’ve always been extremely introverted. Never had many friends in school and after graduating had none at all. Although I come from a large family I’m not close with any of them. My life has always felt like Ive been watching it from the outside, a out of body experience but all of the time. 
I used to like to be alone, it was comforting. I could what I wanted, even if that was nothing at all. 
But now at 22 I look at my life it hits me hard that I have nothing going for me. I see my family and coworkers doing things with their lives, finding there people, starting families, doing something. Part of me wants to want these things. But I don’t want these things, maybe because I don’t see them for myself? I think about just drifting away, I’ve come close several times.

I can remember being suicidal since I was 9 years old,"I just want to die all the time. I have this amazing partner and we talk about getting married but every once in a while I try to explain to him that I will probably die from suicide and if he wants to be with me I need to be honest with him about that. 

I'm weirdly ambitious and efficient at work. I'm like a few months away from being a registered dietitian. The night I overdosed in high school I had my clothes set out just in case I had to go to school the next day... I didn't I was in the hospital for a month but I was ready to continue doing what I had to and was supposed to. 

Idk it's just such a part of my identity. I don't have a means to kill myself and I don't honestly think I have it in me to slit my wrists and I actively avoid owning guns for the reason of it would def kill me in a minute and my partner knows that. So when people ask, like psychologists and stuff, I say yes, I think about suicide every day but I don't have a plan. 

Idk just reaching out. I can't talk to anyone about this without them being weird about it or me feeling judged. 

Fuck just wanna die all the time but I keep on living and working and maintaining a relationship but if I really wanted to I would cut ties with everyone and just do it right? 

Funny thing is I'm on Reddit all the time but the first time I actually went and made an account was to inquire how to effectively kill myself. I guess those subs don't exist anymore cause reddit got some heat? Idk, what do I do?

there’s no way out,"i don’t know what i want to do with my life. everything i think sounds nice takes so much work and effort, and im so tired. everyone around me seems to know what they want and have no problem going out to get it, working hard with their passion. my boyfriend is an extremely talented musician and does what he loves everyday, and he’s amazing at it. my roommates all have success in their future, they’re on the right path and are extremely goal oriented. even if they’re not going the traditional route, they’re still going to be so successful in what they do. 

i don’t have any passions. i used to love making art, but i ruined it for myself many years ago, i hate doing it, i get the urges to create all the time but it’s taking such a toll on my sanity because no matter what it turns out awful and i end up suicidal over it.  my boyfriend always tries to get me to create, whether it be art or writing lyrics to appear on one of his songs. it’s never turned out the way i wanted it to, and i physically can’t settle for anything less in my eyes, no matter what others think. i feel like i’ve disappointed him because he always talks about how he wants everyone to create art, but i’m broken, i can’t do it. 

i love helping people and making others feel good, but that’s about it. because of this i work in a minimum wage retail job, barely making ends meet. out of all my roommates i make the least amount of money. it’s embarrassing and painful, and i’ve applied to numerous other jobs but i can’t get in anywhere. i’ve tried different medications, different doses, none worked, i ended up just not taking them a few months back. i feel like the most uninteresting person on earth. i never have anything to add to a discussion. my boyfriend is always so talkative and wonderful, and i feel like i’m dragging him down because it’s like every other day now im miserable, can’t talk for shit, and i end up texting a suicide hotline again. 

i’ve been feeling like this since i was 12 and im almost 19 now. i’ve spent all my teen years miserable. i’ve been abused, assaulted, bullied, and struggled with anorexia on and off. 7 years is enough time for things to have gotten better right? i don’t think it’s going to happen anymore. i did everything i could. i did the medications, i did therapy with several different therapists, i got out of abusive relationships three times and now i’m in a healthy one, i got out of my toxic household and now i live with my roommates in a shitty apartment, i got a new job that still isn’t enough to live comfortably, i even tried shrooms, thinking they’d make me realize some shit to make me stop being so fucked up inside, all it did was get me high. i get high every day just to survive now. i guess what i’m trying to say is it just feels like i just need one more push and im off the ledge. i don’t have any hope for myself, for my “future”, for anything. i always knew even when i was a kid exactly how i would die. the only reason why i’m not doing anything tonight is that i’ve got a family event to attend to tomorrow, and i don’t want to take the attention away from my family.

i just want to kill myself. i just want to die. i don’t want to keep going on like this and there’s no way out. im disappointing everyone i love just by the way im living right now. it feels like no matter what action i take, it’ll hurt people, so i might as well do the one that will be the permanent solution to my problem.",hiraethtrash,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tubfgg/theres_no_way_out/
My Dreams Has Been Crushed And I Can't Do Jack Shit About It...Fuck Mental Illness,"I'm 23 and I've been through a shitstorm of failures and inconveniences growing up because I had ADHD, anxiety ,and major depression. I nearly didn't make it out of high school (graduated back in 2017 yay me) because I have difficulty with learning and comprehension, I have a tendency to forget things easily, and having a hard time trying to focus. The shit followed me into college ,where I was majoring in IT Support (I have a love for tech and video games), and I flunked out due to said mental illnesses. Not wanting to let it overcome me, I decided to join the Army as a 12B Combat Engineer (I loved military stuff and wanted to join as a kid) and left my state (Georgia) to ship off to Fort. Leonard Wood, Missouri to begin training. I made it into white phase (in Army OSUT, we have red, white, blue, black, and gold phase), but then of course, my illness got the best of me. It was interfering with my training badly enough to where I actually ended up being pulled from training and getting a Chapter 5-10 (EPTS separation) and ended up being sent home on 22 March 2022 (in total, my company had up to 51 non-trainers being discharged due to misconduct, suicide attempts, etc, and the number was large enough to make a 4th platoon when we had 3.) During my time as a non-trainer, we just did details such as cleaning, weapon detail, etc. What killed me is the fact that I wasn't able to graduate into AIT with my former platoon battle buddies and I watched the ceremony where they had a Engineer pin placed on their collar by the Drill Sergeants and the higher ups. I felt like absolute shit because I wanted to be in the ceremony as well, I wanted to prove myself that I can be the best of the best and make my family and friends proud. Now, since I'm home now, I've been hella depressed because I didn't graduate and my fam and friends were looking forward to seeing me walk on the stage. Nobody, aside from my parents, talked to me since. Felt like I disappointed them all because of an illness that was out of my control and I hated my life because of it. I've should've done this before but I'm planning on going to therapy to get it treated ASAP. I'm tired of shit backfiring and I want to have a successful future man.",FINALKUTKING-33,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tubezp/my_dreams_has_been_crushed_and_i_cant_do_jack/

Self hate,"I’ve been dealing with deep depression for about decade now, and I’m not so sure how long I have until I hurt myself to the point I might take my own life.

I desperately just want to take my own life but I don’t want to let the people who say I’m a great person and that they look up to me know that I am a weak coward that isn’t as strong as they thought I was. I have attempted suicide in the past and I still have regret for not doing it correctly the first time. Everyday for me is the same constant pain of wanting to exit this world, even though I have people there who say I can always talk to them, I don’t want to bother them with my mental issues. After all they already had friends before they met me so I’m sure I don’t mean much. I recently made a noose as well and have been debating daily if I should use it.

"I have contemplated suicide a couple of times during my lifetime, but recently it has gotten much worse.","In my lifetime, I have had a couple of major depressive episodes where I think about suicide. (I've never been officially diagnosed with depression but these episodes have lasted so long and shared the symptoms with clinical depression, therefore I believe depression was the cause.) I have never made a plan or even come close to making one, but during these times it is always on my mind. It didn't matter my age either, the first time was in 7th grade and all I wanted to do was not exist. It mostly happens when I get isolated socially, for one reason or another. For example, COVID put me in one of these ruts. After I get isolated it's like every bad thing I could've shrugged off the day before suddenly compounds itself onto the next bad thing, and the next, etc.

The episode I'm in now started because I was cut off by a pair of close friends that I had made the previous semester. These two were also pretty well connected with the rest of the people in my (minimally-populated) major. I don't know what these two told the others, but now everyone ignores my texts and makes me feel like I'm not ""in"" with them anymore. I can't avoid seeing these people because they are in my classes and I just feel so alone some days. I can tell that I look like a fucking weirdo avoiding their glances and just listening all the time, but nothing else makes me feel ok being around them. Just a couple of months ago, I was hanging out with all these ppl, studying or drinking in a dorm room and just having a good time. I was so proud of myself because before I got to college I was always quiet and had a hard time finding new friends. All of a sudden I lost all of it.

I will be honest so that there's no confusion. I was sexually (not romantically) involved with both of these two close friends. I always made sure to respect what they wanted and maintain a healthy dialogue. I tried to keep up with them even when I noticed they weren't talking with me as much, but all I got were dead-ends, so to speak. I've been trying to contact them so I can talk face-to-face with even just one of them, but they ignore me at every turn. The worst part is that I didn't even know what I did. The fact that I don't know the truth, the real reason they've cut me off is what's causing me to be so stressed and sad. It was just all fun and games and sex and then nothing.

I'm not expecting any real solutions from this.  I mostly wanted to vent and talk with someone about it. If I were to ever talk about this with anyone I'm close to, they'd be fucking shocked and wouldn't know how to react. To reiterate, I'm not actually planning on suicide, but the thought of it is constantly on my mind. I'm the closest I've ever been though. I have a rifle at home, and the other day I rested my forehead against it. I had already cocked it back, and I put my toe on the trigger. I trembled for a bit and then I just took a breath in and pushed it and heard that loud, empty *clack.* Afterwards I just kind of shuddered in my bed for a bit and then went on with my day. I would really appreciate it if I could chat with some people who understand what it's like. You can ask me questions about the situation, or just you know, ask anything ig. For obvious reasons, I won't tell you anything like my name or location. If you know how to get that information you probably already know anyways.

Thanks for getting to the end of this TL:DR, folks.",Valuable_War_307,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tuajz6/i_have_contemplated_suicide_a_couple_of_times/

My little sisters are pushing me to the edge with one who literally threatens to stab people… The one who I used to like to spend time with but now I can’t stand being around her after she called me a “fucking bitch” for taking a screwdriver away from her as she literally made it seem she was gonna stab her sister with it &amp; tried locking her sister in a room after getting mad that her sister was doing her chores ig yesterday. She then had a whole staredown with me thinking that I would be scared of her…. I wish I didn’t have to say it but I somehow hate her….. I wish I didn’t. Aside from her, I have had this issue since forever; Myself. I’ve been through an attempt and failed and had been scared to ever since due to the fact I might survive again. I know death will bring me some clarity but even still I can’t. Maybe I’ll begin to understand my purpose when I am gone. I do have a plan but never intended on using it until I started considering it again recently. Man… The people in my life that I actually like don’t deserve this… but I don’t wanna have to deal with myself anymore. Sorry, friends… family… my love… I am sorry if I end up going through with my plan soon. I feel so very selfish &amp; unworthy of this life that I can’t handle being alive.",ShoSho_Chan,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tu4zd7/i_feel_shitty_tw_mention_of_su1cide/

I don’t wanna hear shit about how “I’m so young” “I have so much to live for”. 

You don’t know me and you don’t know my life, im going to finally free myself from 20 years of abuse oppression and general suffering.

Anyone else?,"Okay I know this sounds crazy but does anyone else feel like their family is trying to get them to kill themselves? A theory I’ve had for a while and the more I think about the more it makes sense. A good example is of how I told my mom I felt I needed to see a therapist and was met with the usual, “What’s so bad about your life?” “Why can’t you talk to me?” “You don’t need any medication”  I mean really what normal fucking human says this shit to their crying child. As a toddler I had extreme tantrums, anger issues, and would hit my self. I still do hit myself I love punching myself in the legs and stomach I know sounds weird but I love the feeling of pain then a slight pleasure. It’s crazy to me to that I was the only child in a family of like 20 children to be like this and they saw nothing abnormal about it. And the shitty part is the reaction to my issues was always “Wow how funny look at the little kid having a fit” and then when they didn’t want to hear you cry they’d just threaten to hit you till you stopped. They weren’t like super physically abusive but definitely seemed like I got hit more than any other kid I knew. So don’t you see how I could believe this? I’ve had suicidal thoughts for years to my earliest memory of trying to die was in 5th grade where I had a rope around my neck and pulled it really tight till my face was about to turn blue. I didn’t pass out I wasn’t strong enough to do it back then or at least not committed enough. I really remember in that moment thinking I wanted to kill myself right there and then. Just a weird thing I had to live with after that and never told anyone about it. Since then it’s Basically been suicidal thoughts on occasion but these last few months I’ve had extreme thoughts that I would act out on them, I even went so far as to find the bridge I was going to jump off of. But I realized if I killed my self that way someone would have to clean up my mass and it could cost thousands of dollars to retrieve my body so not worth it. I now own a ar 15 that would make easy work of my skull when I decide it’s the right time. The only thing stopping me from killing myself now is the belief that if I did I would’ve given them what they wanted and they would be happy I was dead. I think they want me dead for 2 main reasons 1. They hate me and always have, like I said I was a problem child that turned into a extremely anti social elementary school student so I’ve always been the opposite of what they wanted in a son. 2. They wish to take possession of my things, this one Find harder to believe cause I really don’t have very much but alas they still want what I have. Sorry this is kind of a biography rather than a suicide not which seems like is what most people post on here. I’m not really looking for support more like if there’s anyone else out there that can relate also felt good to type this I’ve never said any of this to anyone so finally putting it somewhere is nice. I’ll probably kill myself no matter what though I just don’t see any value of life or living it. No point in having my wages scimmed for 40 years so I can retire in old age and with decrepit body. I will probably kill myself some time in the next three months just guessing I’m going to run out of money in a couple months and yeah not going back to being a wage worker.

my ex close friend ghosted me for no particular reason,"(tldr at the bottom)

TW: mentions of su\*c\*de and self h\*rm

This is going to be a long post so please bear with me, I just need to get this off my chest.

It all started when I (19F) moved to a boarding school in the UK. I am originally from Hong Kong, so the culture and change completely took me by surprise. However, I met this amazing girl (lets call her R \[also 19F\]), who was also a new student at the time (we joined in Y9/Gr8) and bonded over our being new and adjusting to a new environment and whatnot.

All throughout Y9, we were really close, being in the same form room/homeroom before class began, having lockers in the same area, whatnot. I remember being so happy that I had my first close friend which made life easier as I had someone to look forward to meeting during the day. It became more exciting as our friendship grew to include 4 more people, making us a group of 6 (which was actually impressive given my anxiety towards new people much less friends).

The 6 of us would always hang out during lunch, break and after school where we'd hang out in the library (it was mandatory to stay until 6pm after school which ended at 4pm) to do our homework and to just chat about our day. It felt so nice to have a place where I belonged, where I didn't feel left out and overall, just a comfortable environment.

However, that all changed as we moved on to Y10/Gr9 which was the start of our GCSE/SATs preparation. With the added stress and upcoming barrage of practice exams, the 6 of us started seeing each other less frequently as we all had to study individually. However, sometimes we'd still hang out in the library after school to study together as it was a way to destress and to help bounce ideas off each other. It was actually pretty decent, and nothing much happened.

Towards the end of Y10, R and the rest of the group began to hang out together more than usual without me and at first i chalked it up to them just finding it easier to meet up (i was the only full boarder while they were day students) and i would see them at events more often than usual (through their instagram stories and posts). R started to make excuses as to why she couldn't hang out with me, claiming she was busy and I gave her the benefit of the doubt (we were all busy with exams) and so I kept hanging out with the rest of the group as if nothing had happened, though i could start to feel a rift between me and the rest of the girls, but especially R as she was my closest friend.

During Y11/Gr10, we began our preparation towards the final exams (GCSEs) and so meeting up was near impossible. My mother came over to help me revise for my exams and I moved into an AirBnB for the study week we were given to revise. I only saw them during the day, and by this point, R was actively giving me the cold shoulder and becoming really 'off' with me (replying yes/no when asked, no further explanations) and so I didn't mind the coldness as I also wasn't as engaging with the rest of the group as I had different classes than them and so had to study. However, while I was at school, we had longer breaks so we could study and so I asked R if she wanted to study with me (we had two classes together) and at first she agreed, though it was clear she wanted to be anywhere but. I started to harbour a lot of anger and resentment inside of me for her completely dissing behaviour and so when I got home (to my mom's AirBnb), I texted R asking whether I did something wrong, or is something the matter and if so she could feel free to text me. She answered with a simple, 'no, it's just that we're not in the same classes and so we don't hang out often'

I saw that as true in some aspects-it was difficult to arrange meet ups with me outside of school because of the strict boarding house regulations and not meeting would be easier, however, one of my friends from the group (lets call her G) was actually a weekly boarder (boarding 5 days a week, then going home on the weekends) and so i assumed that maybe it was like that with G as well but what really infuriated me was that during school when we would all hang out together during our only times together, G and R were actually really close, always talking, laughing, etc. When I tried to do the same, R would immediately switch and completely disregard what I had to say. I felt completely put aside like I was nothing, and began to harbour some very ill thoughts towards her. Since me and G were actually pretty close (even sharing the same room at one point) I decided to take her aside and asked if R had something against me or whether I had done something. G said she didn't know but she'd ask R (spoiler: she never did) and so I felt reassured that at least it was just R that was being completely off with me.

After GCSEs were over, I was excited to completely turn over a new leaf and began using my weekends productively trying to engage R in activities and basically bombarded her with a truckload of invites to hang out (which in hindsight was a very foolish thing to do-to keep pursuing something that clearly wasn't working), seeing as the end of Y11 equated to more freedom and a looser leash on what boarding students could do. Each time I asked R whether or not she wanted to hang out during the weekend, she'd say 'sure', and then when I pushed to set a permanent date and time, she'd leave me on read or completely ghost the message altogether (i know that she receives notifs for when someone texts her as her phone lights up with said message instead of ""message from \_\_\_""), leaving me waiting for a date that would never come.

Start of Y12, classes got narrowed down to 3-4 choices and so me and R were coincidentally put into 1/3 classes. I was foolishly excited all over again, actively planning to arrange hang outs with her and the group, and so when I went back to school I was in high spirits, excited to see my friends again. This time, everything was better, but my relationship with R was worse than ever. She barely looked my way, sometimes ignored my presence and completely just pretended I didn't exist. I remember vividly being partnered up with her and and so I asked her straight up 'hey, did I do something? you seem angry with me' and the bi-R told me the lame-ass excuse as to why we weren't friends, 'i prefer to talk to people face to face, I don't really text. if you don't respect that then we should be rethinking our friendship'. I was honestly bewildered. She hasn't been talking to me properly for over 2 years and she has the audacity to think we're still 'friends'? What kind of warped mindset was that? I just agreed and left it (it wasn't the appropriate time to fly off the handle) but inside I was completely burning with anger and hatred.

I still so badly wanted to rekindle our relationship even after all this time that my efforts of communication went unanswered or thrown away and some family issues which occurred around the same time as my ex boyfriend leaving me after a year of dating really spiralled me out of control. I resorted to self harm, and a lot of self blame/self esteem issues as well as trust issues. I hated how she kept stringing me along, acting like I was the bad person even though I've been nothing but nice to her and made excuses for her bullshit behaviour when I should've cut her off a long time ago. Although I know in myself I'm no saint (a lot of this could be solved if I just spoke up and been a lot more direct but instead I let it fester into something toxic inside me). I became severely suicidal after Y12 and Y13 (the pandemic did not improve anything for me) and tried to take my life in the school's bathroom in the science department. I really thought that if R had no problem disregarding me like a piece of trash, then the rest of the group probably wouldn't notice either. I was angry at myself for letting R screw me over like that and I was also furious with the group for not noticing the obvious shift in demeanour when it came to me and R's relationship.

I went to R crying once during break as my ex boyfriend left me for someone from my old school (we were doing LD) and it completely broke me. All she said was ""oh"", and left it at that. Now, I understand that it's difficult to react in a situation like that and I totally understand that she wouldn't know what to say, but if you truly valued someone as a friend, someone you care about, checking up on them wouldn't be so difficult, would it? It's not like I'm asking her to buy me a moon right? She acted like nothing happened even as I would come to school crying and full of tears. My friend group did comfort me, especially two german exchange students whom I became close with for a couple months as they saw me crying in the dorms, and told me he was stupid to have let me go. I felt a little better and hopeful that people still cared, and that was the wakeup call i truly needed to pull my head out of the fog.

R simply didn't care. There was no fight, no dramatic ending, just a friendship that fizzled out after years of one side struggling to rekindle a burnt out flame. R didn't care about anything, R didn't care whether I lived or died. That revelation did help me throughout my remaining two years of high school when I had to face her for an hour every day. It helped me become more comfortable in my skin, and to move on even though I never got closure. It hurt for a while, seeing her in class, laughing, talking freely with other classmates and friends, then being completely standoffish with me even though I know in my right mind I did absolutely nothing wrong. It felt like seeing an ex being happy with another partner right in front of you and all you're left are the memories and questions. Why did she shut me out like that? Will we ever become friends again? Did she forget about the good memories we had?

However, this revelation quickly became much darker, as it backfired on me just as quickly as it helped me see things clearly. Because of my new notion of 'R doesn't care about me', I spiralled down into 'R and the rest of the group don't care about me, they don't even notice me gone' (I was off on a class trip with another class that R and the group weren't a part of for a week) and when I returned, nobody even noticed. When G left to go on a class trip with her class for 3 days, R and the rest of the group completely swarmed her with questions of 'how was it?? did you enjoy it?? tell me more!' let's just say it made me very bitter and angry with the complete disregard for my being.

I know people always ask, 'why didn't you just make new friends, if your old group didn't treasure you?' thing is, i did try. I had some friends from boarding houses which I would spend dinners with and that was actually quite nice, however, aside from the night, the day is the majority of where I'd spend with my classmates from my own year (the girls from the boarding house were all in different year groups so we only ever see each other at night and even then it's shifty as they have different house activities that me being a junior/senior would not be a part of). The rest of my own year group had wildly different personalities that being with them completely drained me, making me feel more lonely and isolated. I didn't relate with any of them, and when I did try to add in my own views to their conversations, they would do the same thing R did: go all silent, then change the subject, act as if I wasn't there. Or, they'd engage in small talk with me, then quickly get bored and then ignore me. There was no commonality between me and the other girls and my only friends were the friend group I once felt safe in.

Now, I'm in uni and memories of the time I tried to take my life because of R and the group still haunt me daily. I constantly wish that I had closure, that even if R had simply said ""i don't want to be friends anymore', I'd be happy. This constant waiting, initiating half-assed responses and betrayal really made me feel used and emotionally manipulated, made me question whether or not friends would really benefit me if they were all like R. I wish I could've gotten some sort of closure, I wish so many things would've gone differently. I remember being so bitter in the summer of 2020/early 2021, wishing I could hurt her as much as she hurt me, then going so far as to want to hurt her family for raising such a bitch of a daughter. However, I knew that it wasn't their fault, I don't tell my parents everything and I'm pretty sure she doesn't tell her parents either.

From what I could tell, she was very smart and very outgoing. Her entire family seemed to put a lot of pressure on her to do well (every time she got a bad grade in our classes her entire demeanour would change), she'd act overly happy and excited over minuscule things and in some ways, I could see myself in her. Maybe she had some issues as well that I guess I never got to know, and that caused her to completely freeze me out. In a way, I do feel sorry for her and I hope that she does lead a happy life. Even though our friendship never ended in a solid closure, I guess my own conclusion would be that we're in different stages of our lives now and maybe she's doing better. Although I will never fully recover from what she intentionally put me through, the memories of her betrayal would still haunt me and I guess I'll have to get used to never knowing what truly happened. it sucks, and I guess I'll have to be okay with that.

"[TW: abuse, drugs, alcohol, divorce, sh, suicide] I can't do this anymore. I'm ready to go. I don't care.","I'm only 14.

I'm tired. I can't do this anymore.

I'm close to my father. He has mouth pain. He and my mother just went through a nasty divorce. My father got custody. I must have visitation with my mother, who's abusive and drinks.

Court orders say that neither parent can have alcohol unless it's for a medical reason. My mother must provide transportation every Sunday 10-6, to her place and back. My mother doesn't drive. My father is very kind and decided to bring her down every weekend to stay until Sunday. 

My mother didn't change. She kept her old ways and threatens to take him back to court over every minor thing. I hate her. She is very entitled and stupid. She's a huge narcissist. She's the worst mother I could ask for. I have no female to look up to. 

She wants to report my father to CPS for putting Whisky on his teeth for mouth pain. He spits it out though. He doesn't get drunk off of it. If I get taken from my father, I swear to God, I'm going to kill myself. I won't say how in case someone repeats what I might do.

It gets worse. I have Autism. She and the school said that I'm going to flip burgers the rest of my life. I heard it so many times that I believe it. I'm getting bullied. Nothing's happening. No one does anything about the bullying or anything. 

I want to end. There's no point. I have zero future. The only thing keeping me going is see if I get accepted into a school to graduate with a High School diploma AND Associate Degree. There is no other reason. I've been self harming since I was 9. No one knows. I don't know how to hide them.

"I’m on the edge of my own sanity, and am too depressed for even myself to fathom. How do I bring this up to my friends or family…","I’m not sure how to put this but I feel a lot better confessing to random people than to my own boyfriend (long story…) 

Im so scared to even say anything about this… but I worry if I don’t say anything I might slip and either go off the deep end or end up hurting myself. I’m 2 months away from turning 21, and I’m praying to god that somehow, someway, it opens up new avenues for me. I just can’t handle what my life is currently. All the health issues. All the mental roadblocks and stipulations I’m facing. 

In late 2015 I was diagnosed with severe PTSD, depression and anxiety. On top of that I have really bad ADHD (which I’m honestly convinced is more autism because it follows the patterns of it closely..) and physical health issues such as PCOS, endometriosis, asthma, and newly discovered… 4 slipped discs. I’m constantly in pain and usually come home from my work days bawling my eyes out from pain. I feel like I’m burdening my boyfriend with this. The first time I mentioned the pain he flat out told me “well my grandma has a slipped disc and she sucks it up every day and is just fine”. But I don’t think he is aware of the full extent of my pain. I’m in so much pain constantly I can barely walk. 

To add to why I’m so stressed, I’m working a deadend job selling phones. I’m being overworked and have been stepped on from day one (April 19, 2021-now, quite literally) and haven’t seen an ounce of respect from my job. Everywhere I have applied has denied me for either being disabled, or having piercings. Regardless of my skills, my job experience, etc. The struggle to not quit my job every day is intense. We are understaffed too, and my only friend here, let alone only person in my life who remotely cares about me, is putting in his two weeks tomorrow. So now we will be down to 3 people… 

What the fuck am I supposed to do. Does it even get better from here? Is it worth holding out on? I’m in so much physical and mental pain. No doctor or therapist is willing to help. Whether it be with my physical pain, or with my mental state. I’m genuinely scared of where this can go next… lately I’ve been making the joke that “I have no will to live”. And its becoming a serious thing now. The only reason I keep going is for my damn cat, because I know her little spotted butt would die of heart break if she couldn’t see me anymore. She’s such a happy baby… she follows me everywhere like a dog. I don’t think my boyfriend has even picked up on how I’m feeling mentally and I’m scared to death to tell him because he’s been working 4am-6pm Tues-Fri and I don’t want to bother him… he doesn’t seem to want to interact with me lately like he used to… which sucks because we just moved into our own apartment a month ago and I need him now more than ever. 

I can’t keep doing this anymore. How do I bring myself to tell my friends or family without hurting them…? I’m afraid of what actions I may take in order to make myself feel okay again.. Whether it be suicide or straight self harm.

"committing suicide because I literally lost everything,","It's hard to type out everything I need to say because I'm on a phone because I had sold my 5 grand computer, have no internet, hard to type without a keyboard otherwise I'd post every detail. So anyways I lost everything, my family disowned me, my mom lost her job 5 years ago and I waited patiently for her to pull everything together for me, I'm 100% dependent on other people for everything, food, medicine, money, everything, 


Before I go any further I am 24 years old turning 25 this month. You may find me to be an extremely pathetic individual. But I am what I am and nothing will change who I am or what I think.

I want to get on disability but i don't think I'd get approved because I don't have multiple diagnosis only ADHD but I have Autism, OCD, PTSD, major depression, and I am completely dependent on drugs to perform basic tasks, like going to sleep, getting out of bed and eating food, Suboxone, dissociatives, phenibut and a plethora of many others, 

My remaining support system is unemployed and they are selling the last of their belongings to support me and the money is running out fast then I'm going to fall, Hard. 


I used to have beautiful waist length hair, I cut it all out in Massive mental breakdown and my didn't stop me or de-escalate me. I now have intense massive dysphoria and discomfort with myself, i used to be able to masturbate to my own appearance and other people would pay money to see naked pictures of me and a few paid 250 to have sex with me, now I lost my only self sufficient money source.  

I also have hairloss genetic and can no longer afford the finasteride but I also cannot wait 10 years for my hair to grow back. I'd look much older by then anyways and can no longer make $ off my appearance. I used to get compliments all the time in public now everyone just ignores me with boring shaved hair. Just another brick in the wall. Move along. I don't think it matters anyways anymore because I cannot maintain such long and high maintenance hair without drugs for the energy just to take care of it, let alone take care of myself.


This is only the beginning, my grandma and uncle moved away from me because they see me as a ""lost cause"" they sold all property and left, they are leaving me no inherence, they think I'll just blow it on drugs but I'm not abusing them like an addict, I'm prescribed Suboxone for withdrawal so I can sleep and eat and shower and do basic stuff, otherwise I kick holes in walls in Intense restlessness and poop and pee in my room cause I'm too weak to move around, my teeth are rotting out and my parents won't take me to the dentist, 

They won't help me get on disability, 


Again being on a phone makes it extremely difficult to type out my situation in detail. There is much MUCH much MUCH more to it this is just the tip of the iceberg barely that 

Basically my life is fucked I have 2 arrest warrants for me and I lost everything. I'm going to be homeless in withdrawal soon. 



My plan is to get some fentanyl, taper off the Suboxone and shoot up a whole gram at once, I would Prefer to take benzodiazepines with it so significantly reduce anxiety of my respiratory system shutting down and to significantly increase chances of a successful death. 

My plan is a DIY lethal injection. Hanging is too painful, suicide by cop is painful, I cannot access pure helium anymore it's all cut with air , 

The only humane painless way out of this living nightmare is death. My parents REFUSE to get jobs and work and make money to provide for me a good Life, stability, happiness, and normalcy. They sleep all day, and they are selling the very last of a belonging that costs 20,000 but after that, it's over no more stuff to sell. 


I'm disabled!! I cannot work I've already tried I've failed at every job and cannot barely hold myself together basic hygiene 


My parents are narcissistic especially my mom and they think I have no hope of recovery they harp and tell out ""I thought you were going to be self-sufficient"" 

In reality I could pull it together if my parents were pulling in the money but nope. 


So do you guys think fentanyl opioid alone will be enough to kill me or would a benzo make it much more likely more painless? 

I only have $500 to my name as of now and I can buy some heroin fentanyl laced dope and shoot the gram . 

If I cannot acquire The drugs I might have to go the route of suicide by cop.. the problem is that I have A vERY VERY low pain tolerance and getting shot to death sounds like a nightmare but it would be worth it to suffer for a couple minutes then be homeless and withdrawaling and starving. Again no computer so be lucky I'm typing it out as good as I am.


Just an opiate overdose alone without a benzo to shutoff my pathetic consciousness that inhabits my body, just a self aware pile of blood, flesh, bones that is dependent on other humans to do everything for him (I don't even drive for God sake)  with no benzo it sounds like it might be more painful. Had I had a couple hundred more I could afford a benzodiazepine but even if this doesn't kill me I'd be happy to be brain dead vegetable and my parents pull the plug on my life support than be constantly stuck in obsessive crippling thought loops I had to take huge doses of DXM and ketamine everyday just to keep myself from going insane and hurting someone dissociatives were the only thing that brought me peace because I wasn't aware of anything my mind was shut off and I didn't even know who or what I was what being a three-dimensional human is like while dissociated, but with tolerance and lack of funds, all that is coming to a close. 


So to sum it up drug overdose fentanyl and heroin injected. 


As you can read my post my situation is hopeless and this is a rare exception where suicide is truly justified. Hmm what will the parents think of my rotting decaying corpse? Will they laugh in joy or will they regret and wish they had helped me more? 


The thing is I could live a happy fulfilling life but my parents won't get up off their ass pull up their boot straps and WORK.

AITA for not wanting to move in with my suicidal boyfriend?,"Me (22f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been dating for 2 years, we have had ups and downs but all in all I think both of us see that we could have a future together (although probably him moreso than me) there was a particular bad patch where he was suicidal multiple times in a few months, three of these times while in an active argument with me where he locked himself in another room and hurt himself. This led to therapy and antidepressants.
Since then we have still argued but the suicidal tendencies have lessened. However family issues means he now has to move out and would like to move in with him, however this increased stress of late has led to familiar arguments and stuff from the last time before he started becoming more suicidal again. 
So AITA for being afraid to move in with him because I am uncomfortable and afraid that our relationship could cause him to hurt himself again?

Bad luck,"I am 16 years old. My entire life I had grown up to experience many amazing birthday parties, all except my own. My birthday happens to fall on March 26th which where I’m from is the time of year when everyone is out of town on end of season sports trips so every birthday I was pretty much alone. For my 10th birthday I was excited to have my first “double digits” party. I worked so hard planning, I had my favourite chips and the new Disney movie planned. Everyone was supposed to show up at 6. I waited patiently. Minutes went by ever so slowly, I asked my mom where everyone was she said that they must be running late, I waited more. An hour had passed, that’s when I realized no one was coming. It wasn’t as if I didn’t have friends, I just didn’t have friends who cared enough to come. The same thing went on for the years to come and I was cursed with a sequence of birthday I spent alone in my room crying wondering why I wasn’t enough for anyone. This year I turned sixteen I was so excited to throw my party but my parents have a sports tournament so they said that we would throw it the weekend after, which I was skeptical about because of my bad luck with birthdays, my mom promised me this year would be different. I stupidly believed her. The weekend my party was supposed to come my entire family except for me caught Covid and my party was cancelled. I was devastated knowing once again there was nothing I could do, I begrudgingly at my mothers request postponed it for the following weekend, only for it to get cancelled again due to Covid. I had put so much effort in. I finally had friends who could come, the perfect menu, perfect plans and everything was how I wanted it to be but no it was cancelled again. I was talking to my mom about how I was feeling and she said I needed to stop wallowing in self pity. And that’s when I decided I was going to kill myself. Nothing is getting better. No matter what I do no one will ever care about me, nothing will ever work out in my favour and im so sick of being disappointed and I can’t take it anymore. I know this all sounds insignificant but it every year on the day that was supposed to celebrate you you ended up alone in tears, maybe you would understand too why I can’t do this anymore.",peacock491,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tu5ovr/bad_luck/

And before you say I’m putting my happiness on one person and that happiness comes from within etc, 1) everyone else I’ve met has been an asshole or at best fake as fuck. 2) The idea we’re supposed to be happy for happy sake just on our own is stupid, like we’re solitary creatures not meant to have people in our lives that we love. Science shows we need relationships in our lives one way or other for good mental health, and that loneliness is actually harmful for our physical health too.

The breaking point. An email to the only person I know would listen.,"I've been made out to be a monster and a disappointment by my own family. 



I'm looking at these cars drive past, the green fields infront of me, and the sunset to my left. I don't want to be here, i wish i was just someone else somewhere else. I hate my life, I'm surrounded by people who in reality dislike my existence, i feel I'd be doing a favor by not returning home. I wish i could restart my life and make sure I never hurt anyone ever, i guess these are the consequences of my actions. I knew years ago it would never get better, i knew years ago that I'd end up like this again. I'm in the same spot, with the same choice to make, and i don't think i can take the walk back home.


 I feel like a failure, i know i am. I miss the times where i wasn't looked at like this. I honestly wish i got hit, because the amount of painful stuff my family, the ones that told me they loved me when they found out i tried to commit suicide 5 years ago, thinks about me and hides from me hurts more than any regular punch could. 


I wish i had the courage to just jump infront of a car right now, i guess my dad is right about me. I wish they only knew the reality of why it's pains me so much to go outside and be around people, all that goes through my mind is hoping whatever car bus or tram I'm in crashes. being confronted by such a bright world only makes me feel worse inside, it makes me feel guilty for being like this in a world so beautiful.

Nothing helped. There's no help. I don't know what the help was supposed to be but i didn't find it. I got a lot but nothing to keep me here. Many things made it worse or easier but nothing made it survivable. There's no help for this thing called life. It's agony, death and misery, without help. The only consequense of staying here has been causing more suffering and dying now will cause more suffering. It was not worth it. None of this has been worth a shit. Help never was nowhere to be found. Not here. Here is nothing but death for everyone. The only help there is is death, ending this life. This is the result of staying here 20 years past the day i understood there is no hope here. There really wasn't and i sincerely looked for every where.

I got caught in an awful spiral about 20 years ago. Toxic environment at home, found gambling and porn to escape, and now those are the only things I care about or that make me feel alive at all. All I really want deep down is a normal life. A girlfriend or wife, maybe a kid or 2. I'm just sick of being alone. Porn and casual sex doesn't help at all. In fact it makes it way worse. I've tried cutting back and cutting out the porn and hookups and it just makes me feel even MORE alone. At least when I was hooking up with girls I could talk and cuddle for a bit after. But now I have no one. I don't really know what to do. I literally feel like I can't even get a girlfriend. Even though that's what I want and need. I can be friends with guys but I'm not attracted to men so it's just normal friendship and that's fine but I need someone to care about me and actually give a shit on a deeper level.

My name is Sky, and I'm in a poly relationship with 2 other girls. I love them both so much and all I want in life is to protect them and be able to help them through any dark times that they may be going through. Which is where one of my girlfriends comes in, I'm going to call her SL for sake of privacy but, SL has a lot of problems with depression and suicide herself. And for a long time I've been doing my best to help them, all I want in life right now is to see her smile.  


But I just can't seem to protect her, nothing I do seems to work. No matter how hard I try I can't even make her smile, not once. And it hurts a lot, not being able to protect her and just make her happy. And as of an hour ago, she has stopped responding to any attempts of me trying to call her, which has happened before but never for this long. And I'm starting to think the worse, I'm scared i wasn't able to help her. She is the only thing that can manage to talk me down from ending everything, and now that she might be gone I'm having these thoughts with no way to get them out of my head.

It has been 6 days since my partner has left. He’s gotten rid of every trace of me. His parents don’t even know I’m pregnant. Only 6 days has passed and he’s already moved onto another, and is posting like I never even existed. 

How could I have been so stupid? How could I have been so wrong? How did my life come to this?

It has been 5 days since my last bit of hope for life died out.

It has been 4 days since I last spoke to my best friend. 

It has been 3 days since this all started to sink in.

It has been 2 days since I’ve last slept.

It has been 1 day since I’ve last eaten.

Today, I’ve settled on giving up. I can’t handle this anymore. I can’t live with my regrets. I have all his cruel words burned into my brain, the yelling, the accusations, the texts. I can’t let them go. 

In the darkest way, this gives everyone what they want. He gets what he wanted so bad, without it affecting him at all. I get an end to my suffering. 

7 days works out well. It’s enough time to prepare the minimum. I can hire people to clean and move things. I can do my best to make my friends feel settled. I have an excuse to disappear. When I’m gone, they’ll be hurt that I fell off the face of the earth, but not hurt in the same way of having known I offed myself. 

Tomorrow I’ll rest.

Sunday I’ll start my plan.

I've been a burden to my mother and my father. I've infected them with my depression they were unable to heal. I know my death my hurt them, but it will be better for them in the long run. Just like pouring alcohol on an infected wound, it will hurt really badly first, but it will heal it in the long run.


I have no friends left, I've tried for 4 years, only one. And she was more than I could ever ask. But she's gone, because I fucked up. I squeezed her to the point that she left, I don't blame her. I loved her, she was my best friend. And she was the first and only person to say that to me, ""I love you bestie"". Now, she blocked me, she was my last thing I tried living for. She's gone. I gave her all I had, and she gave me what I wanted, what I needed. Now, she's gone. If you see this BB, it's not your fault. Please don't blame my disappeance or death on yourself. It isn't, you held me together, like you held me in your arms a few days ago before you left. You were the best thing that has happened to me, and those best memories that I've had with you will be the last thing I will remember before my death. Though I'm not sure if you still love me after what I did, I still do.


Today was the first time I felt grief. I thought I did before, but, the pain I felt today, was nothing like anything I felt. Felt worse than waking up after my surgery after the anesthesia technician forgot to give me morphine. It felt worse than when the needle hit my nerve during a blood draw.
I felt the true meaning of a heart break. I thought it was a metaphor, or an exaggeration. But, it wasn't. I felt the grief in my chest, my breaths felt empty. My heartbeat felt unreal. The pain, the chest pain when I was crying. I didn't know that could happen.


I've decided to go missing today, run away from my parents, find a hotel far away spend my last days drinking and eating my favourite food, then finding erernal peace.


I appreciate if you want to convince me otherwise, but I've already decided. I don't want anything better, I just want my friend back, and maybe build my life. But, that's impossible. I've tried therapy, medications, groups, suicide lines. Nothing can fix it.

If you want to help. I'd love if someone could comfort me through my last days here, I always felt scared being alone. Id prefer if I didn't die lonely. Someone I could talk about my happiest memories, my biggest regrets. My deepest secrets. I plan on dying on Monday, if not anything early if they find me.

I think I fought bravely. I endured unimaginable hardships. But sadly it wasn't enough. There is nothing to run or fight from. And nothing to surrender to. So, it's best I cease.

I'm so tired,"  

I’ve noticed most if not all of my friendships are a bit one-sided. I’m always the one to initiate conversation. No one ever really sees me and says “Oh, I want to talk to Sam”. No. They won’t initiate any sort of conversation and they’ll go to talk to their preferred friend, if that’s even what I am. I’m more of an acquaintance than a real friend. They’ll say “Oh, I just don’t feel like talking. “or “I’m just introverted” and yet turn around and go talk to someone they actually consider a friend. I’m just someone who can fill some time when they’re bored. So, I’m alone even when I try not to be.

Relationships can be the best yet most regrettable thing you can put yourself into. It’s nice until they decide to drop you like dead weight and it sends you into a spiral. Makes you glad you got to be ‘in love’ for a bit but makes you regret the whole thing because if you decided to just keep to yourself, then none of this would be happening to you. You wouldn’t keep going through numerous amounts of heartbreak and rejection. For that reason, I don’t want to fall in love anymore. Any interest anyone shows me, I ignore it immediately because it’s only me setting myself up again. Love doesn’t really exist. Only living in the moment. And when that moment is over, it’s just you.

I don’t have any real friends like I thought I did, I’ve been in a few relationships that have fucked me up in the long run, and maybe it’s best if I am alone. Maybe my worst fear is something that needs to happen. But I’ll never tell anyone this, because in the end, you’ll always look like an attention whore.

Life is repetitive, same thing every day. I hate myself. I hate these people. I’m tired. Anything seems like an easy escape from this hell at this point. Even if they saw this, nothing would change. They’d look and immediately move on. I’ve shown as many cries for help as I could, now it’s me on my own.

Pre-suicide note,"It's 6:10pm right now on a Thursday. I didn't do my computer science homework that was due yesterday and I skipped lab today in lieu of watching Netflix. What's the point of doing it anyway? I've decided that my death date will be May 12, and in the time that remains I will do things that I enjoy. I no longer care about deadlines or responsibilities. In these six weeks that I have left I want to enjoy being alive. I want to draw, make art, listen to music, hang out with my friends, and write a short novella that will serve as my suicide note.

I have no idea how it came to be this way. As a child I excelled academically and artistically; in high school I graduated in the top of my class and earned a full scholarship for college. Undiagnosed ADHD and bipolar disorder would prove to be invisible enemies as I struggled to meet the demands of college life. When I received my diagnoses in 2020, I felt hope and thought that medication and accommodations would finally allow me succeed, but that was until the pandemic occurred and I was forced to go back home and live in an abusive household.

There are a lot of things that occurred between March 2020 and now, but I don't want to remember them and much less write them down for everyone to read. Put briefly, I am tired. I am a shell of my former being. I can't muster the energy to do anything anymore. I have been sleep deprived for months and, as a result, developed chronic headaches. For weeks I've been waking up and going to sleep with a migraine - even faintly touching my scalp hurts. My GPA has gone to shit and now getting into grad school will be nearly impossible. I'm so behind on schoolwork because I've lost the ability to learn, think, and care.

Due to personal difficulties, I've had to take an extra semester to graduate, which is not covered by my scholarship. I have to pay my school $10,000 by May if I want to receive my diploma. There is no way I'm going to make that money by then. There are no other avenues - my credit score is terrible so I can't get a loan and I can't have my mom cosign either. I only have enough money left to cover rent for April (but not May), and so I intend to only live until then. My mom is supposed to fly in on the 13th to see me graduate on the 15th, so she'll be able to find me.

I hate to see myself, once bright and talented, fade into a sad, apathetic shell of a human being. I've experienced so many difficulties that I'm choosing not to mention and I simply can't cope anymore. As an immigrant and first-generation college student, I've worked so hard for everything, but I am just so tired of being strong.

It’s just not enough to live so that you don’t upset your family or because of the hope that therapy will make it better. 

I can’t remember the last time I felt truly happy.

m18: struggling with suicidal thoughts,"my first suicide ""attempt"" was aged 10. i dont ever actually get the guts to do anything more than hurt myself, because im scared of what i will leave behind. particularly, guilt. my father has abused me emotionally and physically since i was born, and living in a house where i am expected to apologize for reacting to the blatant disrespect my father gives me has almost no longer become tolerable. im not going to commit suicide, at least not soon, but because of depression, and my trauma from my father (and recently abusive ex-gf), living has become extremely hard, especially the transition to college from high school. i was a high-performing student in a very rigorous program, playing sports, exercising, and all in all, having a good time in high school. but ever since i was hospitalized due to a desperate drug overdose a little over a year from now, i have been constantly struggling with the will to pursue a career, continue academics (even though im failing miserably and will probably lose my full-ride scholarship to university), and get back into a ""normal life"". part of me wants to be normal very badly, but the other part knows that ""normal"" is a facade, and isn't really what defines us as people. i've tried spiritual refuge in buddhism, and although i agree with all of its philosophy, i am still struggling to accept the idea that we are ever-changing, and that the idea of ""ourselves"" is nothing more than an arbitrary concept that gives us a word to define a certain point in our lives, because we can always turn stuff around. i dont know what keeps me going; but really it probably is the fear of suicide and the hope that something can get better. i still havent lost all my hope, but its the lethargy and apathy of dealing with every day life that stops me from building something for myself, not to mention how america is quite literally falling apart for the youth (in terms of politics, arts, and religion). i dont even know what this post is supposed to mean; how am i supposed to feel after i post this? what will it change? probably nothing. theres just not much more that i can do than wait, because doing things in the real world, and being successful, requires effort, and quite frankly, i havent been able to find what will drive me to success. i hate feeling unsuccessful, and although all great things have come from failures, i feel like ill permanently be one, no matter how much i resist my parents treating me like i am. to close this, id like to invite anyone else who's parents treated them as wasted potential, or a failure, and have bounced back, and recovered successfully, to share. i am also on medication, and see a therapist. i want to feel better so badly, but no matter what, i cannot find the motivation do to much else than put up a facade to make it seem to other people like i am not struggling. thanks for listening.",Everstorm67,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ttu70m/m18_struggling_with_suicidal_thoughts/
Relapsing after 4 years,"It’s 3am and I’m currently in tears as I re-think my life choices from the past 4 years since my attempt. 

Life hasn’t gotten any better and I feel like a failure to my mother, who looked up to me to attend college after high school (since my 2 older siblings went but stopped after a year— never graduating). However, due to personal problems relating to my Dad, he refused to provide the paperwork that was needed. Not knowing I could proceed with one parent, I gave up and worked full time instead.

Things got worst shortly after. My Dad got abusive in all ways possible (he was abusive since 2010) and refused to pay rent yet he continued to stay in the house and use all of our resources. My mom, at the time, was going through a major surgery so she wasn’t working. I was stuck supporting my family and paying for everything despite not having enough funds. Which lead to living to pay check to pay check, went some days without food or eating bread, etc.

Eventually, we left the house and found a small one bedroom house that didn’t fit all of our belongings. But we had a roof over our head. My mom was a hoarder and had things since 2005 and kept buying things despite not having space or funds. Which lead her to fall into debt. 

After recovery, my mom started working again which was a relief. I can finally save again since I emptied my savings and maxed out my credit cards to support us.

Today, my debt is accumulating as I’ve been unemployed for a year now, I started a business but it’s not going so well and I’ve applied to many places. Why is everyone saying they’re hiring and slow staffed yet refuse to hire?! 

I started the FAFSA form again after realizing I’m able to continue with one parent... but other issues came up and now I’m back at step one. My phone’s mostly gonna get cut off, I’ll be late on my car payment and might get REPO’d and other problems will arise. My credit cards are maxed out again and my bank is in negatives... 

Nothing ever goes my way. I keep holding on for the sake of my mother and just recently gotten into a relationship (which I tend of self sabotage) but I don’t think I can hold on any longer. Everywhere I go, I think of death. I think of ending it and sinking into an abyss of darkness— ultimate peace and no longer suffering. Is it that selfish or should I be selfless? 

When does it get better.

Overwhelmed,"I thought I was safe from my abusive parents but I’m not. I’m 25 and I worked so hard to build a safe space for myself and it isn’t enough. Mom screams at me over text and calls and I feel like I’m 12 and terrified again. I just want to die I never get to rest and I’m still not doing enough. Five classes, working 45-50 hrs a week, supporting husband and I… and it isn’t enough. I keep making mistakes at my job because I’m so depressed and I’m terrified I’ll be fired. I have schizoaffective disorder and I feel like it’s getting worse and I’m feeling so horrible. I just want to die. Maybe then I could do the things I want to do. Husband has never worked and I keep trying to get him to get a job but he won’t. I make 50k but I’m overdrawn after every paycheck because I pay for almost everything. I want to die so bad.

Am I a bad person for not being able to make the people around me/that care about me a reason to stay anymore?,"My therapist made a big point that my behavior (toying around with death the was I have in the past and right now) is atrocious and vile. 
I've told him before that I cannot form close bonds with people and that the thought of others being sad about my passing isn't something I really understand or that I feel particularly bad about. (My mum is the only exception). I've told him how bad I was doing and how suicidal I felt and all I got was accusations that I enjoy worrying people when first and foremost the reason why I am in this state rn (having reall bad Life threatening Lab works because of my own actions) is that I've been stuck time and time again between wanting to live and wanting to die. I am in agony why do I also have to consider how other people might feel about me making harmful decisions in this situation? 
On the bright side, all of this helped me to finally make up my mind on suicide. This time I won't get help and I will not talk about it anymore. Technically I am already closer to death than life anyway. So I finally made up my mind to end it on Monday (depending in a certain event on that day). On the bright side....I might not be a complete psychopath like my therapist said because I find it almost unbareable to look my mother in the eyes ever since I made my decision and writing my letter to her wasn't exactly fun either.",[deleted],3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ttk9wp/am_i_a_bad_person_for_not_being_able_to_make_the/

I'm not, I don't have control of myself at all times. Ive gotten better at getting and keeping control thank goodness but I'm not perfect and I made those bad mistakes that I just wanna be better from.

I want to be a good person so badly. I dedicate alot of time in my days to talking to people and making them feel better but even then I feel like I failed because of this stupid mental illness.

I can't do anything right. My family looks at me and I feel like an alien and a failure. My friends abandon me and call me things that I'm not. Maybe they're right I don't know.

I have failed. I tried and failed. Doesn't matter that I wanna be good, doesn't matter that I wanna be better, doesn't matter about what I am actually good at. I have failed and it feels like a monster inside me has thrown spears that have stabbed through my arms and legs pulling me back.

Am I being petty? Or is my life really just this bad??,"So basically, this is what I need some advice with. I am bad at explaining things, so I might have missed alot of pointers.

Right now I am a 19 year old girl that goes to college, I am honestly really trying my best to get the grades I want to achieve to get into University. I don't have a job and I get criticized for it in my household even though I am going to college and so far I have the highest level of Qualification in my household. I have tried to find jobs in the past but I didn't get the jobs I applied for. Because I do not have a job, my family says that I am ""required"" to do the household chores, even though I am constantly working on a college project. But that is only a small fraction of my problems I am facing right now...

The years I have been here, have been terrible. My dad has been in and out of prison for a while and only has he recently started to live with us as a ""family"" despite my mum knowing my opinion about it she still brought him in anyway. He says he ""raises"" me but he has never been there for me. He only ever talks to me now if he wants something, and if I say like ""wait a minute"" to something he wants me to do he goes in a rage and calls me a disappointment and all the other names he calls me, such as ""selfish twat""and ""cunt"" sometimes he reminds me I am a disappointment. He is one of my main reasons as to why I am depressed. He accuses me of things that I would never do and when I get angry about it he assumes I do them but I am sure that anyone would be angry if they got accused for something they haven't done.

My brother talks to me like I am trash and I am getting sick of it, I told him today that I will not do anything for him till he talks to me with some respect and like an actual human being and he still spoke to me like trash.

My family labels me as ""lazy"" because I am still at college and when I have a break from it, I just sit down for a bit to have a break. I cannot sleep because of my depression, I overthink on a night time. Everyday I wake up, I have nothing to wake up for. Nothing ever gives me a reason to, I have no motivation and interest in things anymore. I wake up and I instantly want to go back to sleep and nobody understands that, or understands me. My family always compare me to everybody else and I am sick of it to the point that I feel like a burden to everyone I know and that I am a waste of space.

I overthink and I cannot sleep on a night but majority of the time my family thinks it's because I am on my xbox or my phone but it's actually not that at all, It's because I am in a constant battle inside my head whether to just end my life or not. I go on my phone to distract myself from these thoughts and so that I do not take myself upon the actions I have thought about.

I have got a history of Self Inflicted pain upon myself, I have tried to OD before going to sleep in hope that I do not wake up in the morning however that one time was unsuccessful, my mind is in constant circles. I want to ask my family questions but I can't because they won't understand.  What have I done to deserve all of the shit I am getting? Why am I labelled as a ""lazy"" person when I have to stay awake to the point of passing out so I don't act upon my thoughts? Why am I labelled that when I get less sleep than most people my age do, I get 1-3 hours sleep each night. Why do people expect so much from me when I physically can't do everything they ask me to do. Everything feels overwhelming.

My dad can't wait for me to leave for university and I can't wait to leave him. My sister seems to think I can't sleep because I am on my phone but it's not that at all but she blames myself for not being able to sleep. I have tried everything to sleep but I just cannot.

I stopped taking my antidepressants because they wasn't working, they was making me worse. Despite being on them for over 3 months, everybody I know. When they're angry they take it out on me and I don't know why.

My family don't understand how my head and my depression has taken over me, they think after a week after I started to take the medication it worked but it didn't. They think I would use my depression diagnosis as an excuse to be rude to people even though I have felt like that for years. I am going to university to get away from it all.

My family are also inconsiderate about me also, they booked a holiday to not miss my aunt's birthday but they booked it so that I miss freshers week and my first week of University. Shortly after, I'll be 20 next and I wont have anyone to celebrate with because they took freshers week away from me. They make my life harder than it needs to be. They expect me to have found my own place on my second year of Uni so to move out permanently. They are not appreciated of me and what I want to achieve. My dad says I disappoint him even though I am the only one in my household that is going to get a Bachelor's Degree in Film Production. Yet my older sister got pregnant at 17 and she's not a disappointment? Everyone else in my house has it easy but me, I do not feel like I can talk to anyone in my house? But honestly, what have I done to anyone to deserve what I'm getting?

But really? Am I being petty? Or is my life really this bad?

I'm tired of being tired and it's starting to reach a point I can't handle anymore.,"I feel almost completely empty. Getting out of bed is a task of itself if I can even sleep. The common thing to happen these last few months is I'll lay in bed for hours just trying to sleep. So tired and sleepy but my mind racing. Even when I do sleep my dreams are nightmares, not even normal scary stuff just my mind mocking me with dreams about things that remind me of my suffering. All I can think about is how miserable I am and how lonely and empty I feel. Then it continues to snowball until I think about killing myself. My only escape is work where I am not isolated, if I don't just not show up. I'm at a point in my life where I need to start thinking about how I'm going to make my living and become an adult. But it feels so overwhelming and I'd rather just keep going through the motions until I've exhausted myself to the point of not being afraid of death anymore. I wish I could stop thinking. I'm lost in my mind and I feel like I'm going to lose it. I have no friends and I don't have the energy to. I can't even communicate with my family or even honestly care about them much at all. I don't really care about anything. Not myself, not a future, and not anyone I'd consider loved ones. I did get out of a relationship a few months ago as well which did trigger this, but the feelings persisted long before and even were part of the reason it ended. The relationship did nothing but reduce already well established feelings I've had for years. I was hoping she would help me but only pushed me down further. I wasted my last bit of mental energy trusting her to help me. All I've done for years is go through the motions. Just barely enough to get by and have money to live. Now that I have no emotional support I am rotting away. I can't help myself. I can't feed myself. I can't even think about anything besides how much I hate being me. I try my best to do what I can but I really can't do much for myself anymore. I don't know what to do.

But before we knew this his sister had an 8 year old somewhat disabled child who was neglected and he called me his best friend after playing with him for one day. 

But because my dog had separation anxiety and barked when I was gone my mom forced me to give him away because people complained and almost got me evicted. I refused for so long and she said I should give him to his sister and her 8 year old so I stupidly gave him to them even though I knew the relationship would probably end soon. But because he called me his best friend I didn't think about it like a fucking idiot.

His sister said I could call and visit anytime to be with him but the day after that he abused my mom and I had to help her from her boyfriend. Then that night I realized the idiotic choice I made and literally had a cluster of seizures that almost killed me ( I wish they did ). His sister refused to answer any calls and her rapist boyfriend refused to do anything about that situation (obviously). I then realized that there might not be anything I can do to get him back.

I tried everything I possibly could to get him back but there wasn't many options whatsoever. This happened two years ago and my mom was in a court case with him the entire time but it just ended which means there is no possible way to contact any of them and I'm broken.

A small portion of my brain is telling me I have to accept it but a massive portion of my brain is telling me there has to be a possible way to get him back and I can't find anything and I'm crying over it constantly. I want to die so bad and I've tried many times in these past two years but I can't die because I still can't do that to my family but I'm getting closer and closer to do so.

"What the fuck happened, man?","I’m really struggling to understand what went wrong. I just don’t know, and I feel like it’s just me at this point. Not something about me, all of me.

Just in case I finally lose my mind one day and do something stupid, I want this to serve as the why to everything. My side of this entire ordeal. It’s going to be long, and I don’t blame any of you if you skip right through this post. I would, too.

I grew up with a regular family, a single child. My parents were always present and attentive of me. I hated school to death and was a bit of a pain in the ass when I was little. I liked hanging out with my friends over at school and couldn’t care less about grades, it was kindergarten/elementary, in the end. I had a small, but solid group of friends and we would do everything together. I also became really interested in video games. I didn’t know exactly what I liked so much about them back then, but I just did. My parents would frequently scold me about my mediocre grades like most parents would, and I would straight up not give an ounce of fuck. I’d very much rather hang out in school and play video games with friends back home. It was all manageable, I could easily get the bare minimum with minimal to no effort. I also got into instruments (guitar), but it was all in a very on and off manner.

Middle school was mostly the same, until we all started becoming teens, I really struggled outside my friend group and especially with girls. I knew all they way back then I am a non-starter, and almost completely undesirable. I fell in love with this one girl and would just try everything in my power to make her like me, all to an (inevitable) failure. I eventually started making up stories to not seem as lame to them as I really was, and grew insecure. 

Things really started to take a dive when my grades dropped well below the bare minimum, and I didn’t do anything about it. I managed to fail an entire semester just because I stopped giving any attention to school. But I did have other ambitions, I wrote a couple stories here and there, and really shitty poetry. I also started taking guitar, piano and drums much more seriously. Also swimming, which I had done since elementary to at least keep strong regardless of how fat I was. There was a friend there that took swim class with me along with another girl that was also friend of hers. I usually just made friendly chatter with this other girl, nothing beyond a really short conversation during our breaks. 

One day, February 14th, 2018 I get a joke serenade from this other girl. The next day, I get called to the principal’s office because I had apparently harassed her, and that warranted an immediate expelling from school. I wasn’t even allowed to defend myself in any way, and  there was no investigation. It was just a done deal situation. It all happened so fast I didn’t quite process what had happened until a couple days later. All of a sudden I had lost the place I basically lived life at and had done so for nearly 8 years. I resorted to games quite heavily as my main means of keeping in touch with them while I figured out what the fuck I was going to do as of school. 

I eventually finish middle school in may 2018 through a government program, and I skip a year of middle school. I get into a really good high school because my grades from school were overridden by the program’s. I felt pretty good about life, even if I still wasn’t exactly OK from what had happened.

This is the part where it just shows how fucking pathetic I am. August-December 2018 was the best time of my life. By far.

In high school I met this really cute girl who seemed into me. My grades were fine, I was thinking of starting a band, and life was good. We start dating and it’s just a completely new way to view life for me. The feeling I got from knowing someone wanted to be around me and that someone was interested in me and loved me was too good for words to describe. I wanted to give the world to her, make her feel special and show my appreciation for her every second of the day. I put a lot of effort into the relationship, and it felt good. Fuck, just remembering the way she smiled and laughed is making me tear up. 

One day, something just stops ticking inside me, and I start dropping grades, exercise and my hobbies again. I genuinely can’t explain to any of you what happened.  I don’t know and god knows I’ve tried to figure it out. I still tried to make her feel nice every second of the day. 

Money back home starts to run short, and tensions are beginning to build. I tried to stay in school through a scholarship, but I wasn’t eligible in the end. My average was 3 points short of being eligible. I could’ve prevented it. I only had one job, and I failed. And my failure cost me school again.  I remember the last day I went, I didn’t say anything to any of them. I was so ashamed of myself and disappointed I chose to keep quiet, otherwise I would’ve fallen apart in front of these wonderful people. 

The only thing I did do, was hug her as strong as I could. We weren’t dating anymore, as she had found someone else that wasn’t such a waste of time. I couldn’t even say anything. I just held her. She didn’t return the hug. The amount of pain I felt was something else,  but deep down I knew I deserved every bit of it. This was all on me. Still is.

After that, I spent two years doing absolutely nothing other than eating, jerking off and sleeping. My parents got me into an online high school and several diploma courses so that I could come out better than how I got in. I dropped out of all of it. I didn’t even think about it. I just never turned any assignment in. I felt like there was no way it could ever get better. Money was also a big issue by now, and things were tense at home. To which I most certainly added up. Eventually my mom found out that something was clearly going on, and sent me to get therapy (lexapro twice a day, everyday, 6 months.) what my dad said that day I’ll never forget. He said that I was fortunate to have an united family that was going through bad times in terms of money but that we were all healthy and managed to get food on the table every day. He asked me if I had any idea how long and hard he worked to accomplish that, to think about that for a while and to not make him feel like he’s failed me as a parent. I just couldn’t. I remember rushing to the bathroom to throw up because of how absolutely fucking disgusted I was at myself, and I still am. None of this is any was their fault and yet they had to sit through it all and get the short end of the stick. All their efforts to bring me up and set me on a good path that I just threw away and then sat down to bitch about it. 

The meds never worked. I never told them.

A year and a half later, after everyone in my high school had already graduated six months before, I catch a quick test given by an organization that immediately credits high school and has a reputation for being quite demanding. They also have tests that credit you in a bunch of careers, and the most prestigious colleges from my country often have it so those tests count as a part of your final grade.  I took it, passed and got into a good university with a scholarship. And that’s where I’m at right now. But everything is wrong. 

The friends I made in college have already got tired of me. The girl I liked showed interest at first but it quickly went away. My first weeks were good grades, but now I’m really struggling. And it’s not that I don’t care or aren’t trying. I am trying, I’m just struggling. My scholarship is at risk already, the first semester is only a couple weeks from being over. And I’m already worse off that I was a year into high school. But this time, I’m actually trying. 

I try to go back to my friends, but it all just feels hollow. I think they’re only my friends at all because we’ve hung out together for so long, but otherwise wouldn’t. Plus, they’re each going their own way. 

And I just can’t keep up anymore. I can already see how it’s all falling apart around me and I can’t stop it. This time, not even if I try. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I’ve tried to figure it out. I’ve really tried.

"Please help me, I don't know what to do","I'll try to make this short but it will still be a long post so bear with me. Sorry about my English, I'll try to make this as readable as possible. I'm a 25M (not from the US) and for the past 5 years I've struggled with gambling addiction to the point that it's almost ruined my life. Background wise I've got a bachelor's degree and a decent job that allows me to work from home 4 out of 5 days and I make around 1000$ per month (which is decent for this part of the world). 

Now for my issue, I still live with my parents and I'm really close to my dad who I'm very grateful to for all he's done so far. Back in my days at university I relied heavily on the money I got from him since I had no income of my own and I used to gamble a lot of that money to the point that I'd become desperate and have to confess to him about it. He was understanding at first and just let me off the hook, but progressively he stopped trusting me and got more angry about it and asked me to link my bank account with his phone number so he would receive a text whenever I make a transaction (this was exactly one year ago, to the point of which I had already lost around 6k gambling all those years). 

I then got this job and knowing that he gets those texts discouraged me from betting and for a year I managed to save around 6k just from my salary and he started trusting me again. Disaster struck last week when I had to do a wire transfer and I discovered he doesn't get notified because it's only when I pay for stuff with my card...I started small with 50$, then 100$ and soon I was 1000$ down. I realized that soon he's going to get a text seeing the new balance and would have to confront me about it, so I called the bank to cancel that service and did my best to put that money back in before reactivating it...turns out no bank wanted to give me a loan so the only option I had was to chase my losses. Obviously it didn't help and now I'm 3k+ in the drain. He's eventually going to ask me about it since he hasn't received messages for days now.

I'm desperate and don't know what to do, he doesn't deserve this and I know it's going to break him...on top of that he's covered for me all this time and if my other relatives find out they're going to disown me for sure. I won't be the same person ever again. At this point I just want a way out, I'm so traumatized by this that I'd be willing to do anything just to go back to normal.

I'm not allowed to have hobbies or transition,"I work from 5pm-1:30am and barely make enough to rent a room at a crack house.

I feel like even when I desperately try to cling to the edge of a crack they try to force me in.

I didn't even get a childhood due to my drug addicted mother and my father who would beat me and insist I owe him for him taking care of me, a child. I am going to be jumping off a bridge on the way home today when no one is looking if I can manage it.


 I have no one I'm leaving behind since the people in my life shunted me out of theirs when I came out and nothing is going to get better since I still need to desperately try to make rent. There is one person who cares but they're an online friend so they'd never notice since they're an online friend.

it’s so embarrassing. tifu by attempting while not alone.,"boyfriend and i are breaking up and i run into the bathroom to grab something, not thinking at all about how it will affect him, just wanting to end it all because life is so unbearable right now. later he tells his friends and they put me on blast, accusing me of wanting to beat myself up so that he will get in trouble. i wish i had thought twice before i went for it. what i did was not okay. 

i’ve been suicidal my whole life but never attempted because i knew that someone would have to find me and it would traumatize them. and then my family and friends would blame themselves when it’s really just my own shit that’s causing this. 

lately my relationship devolved into very choppy waters and the fighting got unbearable. i normally hâte myself but i really started to wallow in depression more than usual and just started idealizing like crazy. 

the only reason i haven’t attempted yet is because i didn’t want to harm him or anyone else, which is always the reason. but today i reached my breaking point. he held me back and he shouldn’t have had to do that. 

attempting, for me, just reinforces the thought that i am the shitty, horrible person i constantly feel like.

another day closer to the end,"Tomorrow is my last day at work. Saturday I'll see one final escort (or as many as I have to in order to finally get ""satisfied"" as recently I've had trouble with that). Sunday I will hang myself at the pre-chosen bridge. The weekend can't come soon enough. I truly know, for a fact, that there is nothing left in this life that I want to experience. At least, nothing that I want to experience that it's POSSIBLE for me to experience.

Never going to fly a plane. None of these things were meant for me, and none of them are possible for me any longer. I even listed them in order of hardest to easiest.

its gonna happen sooner or later and maybe today,"Todays my father birthday and hes the cause to pretty much all the pain ive suffered. I left his house w police help but even then he tried to lie, even w all the bruises over my then little body. My gf and I are having serious probs nowadays mostly because she fakes who she is and ive been trying for months now to understand her because, yeah, living is hard and being who we are is not that easy, but i suffer from c-ptsd and her trueself doesnt give a f about this. Just some traumatized punk b.tch who cant handle expressing her feelings cause is used to everybody being too afraid of her (she selfharms, is an ex ed, alcoholic and pretty agressive. The kind of person that could literally eat trash looking in your eyes just to make you feel bad) to confront. But im living with her for almost a year now and my mom made pretty clear that she doesnt want me back in her house. Im alone w my dog stuck w someone who only cares about my feelings to make sure nothing will ruin their day. Im in college and have a part time job but in brazil (where i live) u couldnt pay for a bedroom w what i make. Im seeing myself always coming back to her cause i have nowhere else to go, shes asleep now and im seriously thinking about taking some pills and stuck my prettiest knife against me, my dog will be fine cause hes lovely and outgoing, anyone would love to take care of it, and being joyful as is would take weeks to notice im missing and would be just fine later. I just hate living w my memories and being so misinterpreted all the time when im just constantly suffering. I cant even afford the fucking meds to pretend im normal.

Today would be the perfect day to let go of this shit. My dad would remember this forever and i could give him at least some taste of the shit i ate my whole life thanks to him. He broke me and theres no way to fix it, if i really try to live i will be like a mutant or something. I can clearly hear in my mind the sound of the knife coming and going on my meat and its the only thing that brought me some peace in years.

i’m so alone,"my one close friend barely understands why i’m mad at him even though i’ve been trying my best to explain why and i’m so tired. i don’t even know what i want anymore. 
i don’t have any friends, maybe two or three people i talk to in class or when i’m cleaning at work, but no friends. i sit alone in the hallway at lunch, i don’t talk to a single person outside of school or work. my text messages are so empty and i don’t know why i have any social media downloaded it’s not like anyone has tried to contact me in months. 
i have no one. i’m so frustrated and have so much built up mental pain it feels like i’m going to explode but the fact i don’t have anyone i can tell at least a little bit to is so painful and making it exponentially worse. 
i’m so alone already who would even care if i killed myself right now. like three people would notice and i’m sure they would get over it. i don’t see any point in living.

I am in serious trouble bc I can't do simple day to day activities. And I don't even shower anymore, I take a bath like once every 3 weeks to clean myself. I look at the shower and I want to but i just cannotttt. Same applies for simple chores or washing dishes.

A vent ig? Idfk,"Where should i begin eh? Should i start at elementary school when i was a loner and my revolving door of friends 1st started? Freshmen year of highschool when i 1st started cutting where no one could see? My 1st heart break, 2nd one?

How about jr year? I had my 1st kiss, lost my virginity, and then got blocked from that girl? Yeah. Lets start at that year. Give some quick stories. After that girl, i got a gf from out of town. We could only see eachother on weekends. Weekends quickly evolved to a single day each weekend and then to not seeing eachother. Then she went on “a family trip” and didnt talk to me for 2 weeks straight. 

I moved on and jumped straight into a new relationship that was off and on instantly. She lied compulsively and cheated a ton. After her i jumped from hookup to hookup till i was 18. I got a relationship with a great girl till i ruined it. Typical. Then girl after girl that i wanted to date ended up being short flings till i was 19. I finally got a gf… that lasted a whole 2 weeks till she ghosted me. A month later she tells me she blew her neighbor and was in love with him even though he told her straight up he just wanted sex. Soon after i started to fall for my best friend. We kissed, i went to 3rd base, we never had sex. And then she ended up bragging to me about a guy she fucked on tinder. A week later, dating, a month, married, 2 months, moved out of state, 6 months, pregnant.

As i got older, it only got worse. A lot worse flings turned to hookups followed by being ghosted. I got more and more empty. Broken. Desperate. When i was 22 i dated a co worker who turned out to be work bicycle (everyone had a ride) and after 2.5 months, i shattered into pieces. I cut myself in my work bathroom, then more at home. I cried for weeks, till i stopped feeling. I was hallow. For a whole year almost, i was numb. 

I explored the dating pool and mostly whored myself out. Within a year, i had slept with 10 people. As i started to feel real again i started to have feelings for a fwb and she really didnt want to be more than friends. That made me feel great. Then i dated another girl. One who had been lied to and cheated on. And of course, she was cheating from the start and had a “backup bf” that i found from making a fake dating profile and messaging her. I tried to work it out. I fell apart. I cut more. And it failed

I had failure after failure, but tried to have a standard and not settle. Eventually, at 24, i got a new gf. Everything was amazing. Perfect. I snooped on text and found red flags. She reassured me and put them down. At month 5 we planned a kid. And at then she moved in. After 1 year, i proposed. And about a week later, i found out she cheated many times with 3 people for the 1st 5 months. Idk if the kid is mine. And i got a revolving door of friends still. Rn virtually none. Guys just wanna drink with me and girls create drama. I feel trapped and alone and suffocating. Every time i open up to anyone, they leave me. Every date lets me down. Every gf pretty much cheats.

I want to sleep,"This spring it's been 10 years since I was first diagnosed with depression. A month from now it's going to be five years of burnout and anxiety attacks in Uni. I just want to sleep, forget about the whole world, close my eyes and dream. Permanently, if I can. 

I have a good life. Not perfect but not bad. Average in studies, looks, financial situation, work experience etc. Just another Jane in the crowd. Nothing special. I'm smart, not any smarter than my classmates but smarter than some others. I'm introverted but less so than some of my friends. I have a good family, a happy and encouraging mother and a proud and funny dad. They have occasional screaming matches and politics regularly ruin dinner but that's pretty normal in any family. 

I have friends. I just don't think any of them think of themselves as my friends. I like them all and one I have a crush on that will never go anywhere. I love dogs but can't have one at my current apartment. My studies are lagging behind but not by much. I have work lined up for the next summer and fall, work that I find interesting and actually want to do.

Or do I? Honestly I can't tell anymore, I'm practical and think about everything in such an overly rational way that I can't tell if I want to do something or if I just do it because it makes the most sense. I'm a liar, most likely a pathological one. Then am I lying now? I can't tell that either. I honestly can't tell anymore what is a lie, what is an excuse, what emotions are the most powerful, or if there nothing at all. I can't tell and I haven't been able to tell for years. 

One friend who understands has went trough hell in the past two years so I can't talk to her IRL without risking her going off the deep end or cutting ties with me. The others don't understand. My parents would try to understand but dad wouldn't get it and mom would just be overly stressed about the whole thing, and neither of them deserve that, being worried about their kid when they are finally free to live their lives after years of having to look after me. 

I'm rambling. I just wonder if anyone here  can understand what it's like to be fine on the outside, to have everything you need to succeed and be happy but still somehow be empty inside. It sounds like a poem, I know, but it's the best way I can describe it to anyone. 

I don't want to go, mom and dad would be sad. My friends would be sad, but I'm tired and I just want to sleep. 

Tomorrow I'm supposed to go to a birthday party. A big celebration with a band and all our classmates and their friends. Funny thing, I'm the only one who  didn't get a ride to that place. It's in the middle of nowhere, two hours by foot with no busses going there or from there.  Everyone else got a ride, even my friend from downstairs. I didn't, and its not the first time either. I'm the last person they want to invite anywhere, last person who they want to hear speaking to any of them. I know I'm going to come home in the middle of the night, freezing, tired, stressed and with tears on my face for the fifth time in less than a year and I don't know why I can't just sleep and not go.

Im done. Fr this time,"Im at an all time low. Ive genuinely never felt more suicidal than i do now. 

Ive said plenty of times in other posts that i would soon kill myself but i never did. Until now. Im done pussying out. 

Yall can say what you want but within the hour i will be dead. Ive already made sure everything is set beforehand. 

I had a fun day with my few friends to give them lasting memories, i hung out with my parents all week as well as my sister, i sold my playstation, computer, desk, and all my games which amounted to ~ 600 dollars which i gave to my parents, and i made sure my pet was happy and tended to.

 This is it. This is the end. 13 long years the last quarter of which was the worst of my life. Im done. Goodbye. 

Ive written a suicide note which i will not be sharing here as it contains personal information to me and my family. 

The thing is i cannot stop smiling. 
Im so giddy. Im pumped with adrenaline with a gun in my hand. The lord himself would not be able to stop me. Im dead set.

Ive pissed off my ex who i loved so much about 4-5 months ago. She was the first girl to ever make me feel like i matter and now she hates my guts.
She wants me dead. Tonight will be a blessing to her. When she finds out im dead it will dead ass be the best news she's ever recieved.
Maybe this is how i make amends.
Not just to her but to many people.

I can’t do it,"I made a plan. Got a hotel room with bathtub, ate lots of painkillers, sat in the bathtub and held a knife in my hand. I googled “how long does it takes to bleed to death” and an article saying a man stab himself 13 times in the right forearm and 14 times to the left forearm, probably cutting his neck too, and only two stabs in the arms actually went deep enough to reach the arteries. He succeeded. And I actually thought I just have to cut it deep then eventually it’ll be the end, but after sawing that article, I can’t help but think “what if I didn’t die but lose my hand forever “ “what if I didn’t lose enough blood but enough to makes me paralyse or brain dead” blah blah blah. Then I decided not to do it, I don’t know if it’s cuz I’m not sure I’m really gonna be dead after this or just simply don’t have the courage to.

Planning suicide after close death,"Okay I'm seriously close to suicide at the moment . My ( 16m ) girlfriend ( 16f ) of 2 years died last fortnight after being hit on her bike by a car . Her parents telephoned me telling me to come to where she was , I cycled to the crossroads and the paramedics were doing their best . She wasn't in good shape when I saw her but she couldn't really talk but mouthed I love you . I later found out that her scull was fractured in multiple places and she died on the way to the hospital due to internal bleeding . 

When I head the news from the hospital i was speechless and insisted that it wasn't real , she was the Ying of my Yang etc. We completed eachother and now a piece of me is gone . Her funeral is next month but I really don't think I can make it . I've withdraw from all my friends to try and take time for myself including taking leave from school .

 I'm planning a suicide by drowning , to jump of a bridge within walking distance from my house , hopefully the drop will knock me unconscious . The reason why is becuase there is no point living as I found the perfect person , and some retard in a BWM took her away from me .",throwaway726195,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ttadyy/planning_suicide_after_close_death/
No one will read this anyways," Not sure on why I'm messaging in here. Maybe its a final cry for help, maybe it's a sense of closure, or maybe its like closing a book.

I'm probably killing myself this weekend.

I've tried so much. Slews of different medications. Hours of therapy including DBT. Exercise. You name it. Nothing works. 

I'm alone in this world: I've never had a lover or a close friend. I'm alone, but I refuse to live if that's the case. I refuse to live my entire life suffering and isolated. I refuse to live when everyone wants to ignore me for their own benefit.

I've been having so many fantasies of killing myself infront of people just so they can understand how much pain I was in. They won't go away or stop. I've had dreams of shooting myself in the head in a crowd of people at a concert, hanging myself off of a bridge overhanging a busy road, jumping off of a building onto the sidewalk below. No matter how much I try it won't stop. The silence and loneliness is so loud, and I'm at an age where friendship is next near impossible if you aren't good looking, extroverted, or rich. 

I'm too traumatized to make friends.

"Crazy, random intense urge to kill myself - please help someone 😭","I’ve been dealing with major depression and a bad anxiety disorder for years and i’m used to the suicidal ideation, i’m passively suicidal almost every day. But a few times, like last night, i’ll suddenly start feeling what feels like a panic attack brewing and i’ll have intrusive thoughts about offing myself right then and there that scare the shit out of me. I get extremely scared that i’ll actually kill myself against my will (i know it doesnt make sense but its hard to describe) and then my heart starts racing and it gets really hard to breathe and my fight of flight kicks off immediately. It almost feels like there’s something bigger and more powerful than me that takes over in those moments and I almost feel like I have no control over my actions. 

It’s really terrifying and hard to explain. I try to distract myself immediately because I genuinely feel like i’m going to do something erratic on impulse even though I don’t truly want to. I live alone and that is even scarier, not having anyone who could even stop you. 

It seemed to happen out of nowhere last night. I was scared to death that i’d actually run to the kitchen and stab myself or swallow all of my pills or do something to harm myself just because of how strong thought intrusive thoughts were. It’s SUCH a scary feeling not feeling in control of your own mind/body. 

Is it the vaping and all of the nicotine i’m consuming? Is it all of the work stress i’m under? Is it the ADD? Do I have OCD? I feel like i’m losing my mind

Does this happen to any of you? Am I insane? Do I have some other serious mental disorder i’m not aware of? I’m at work right now and i’m having bad anxiety over going home and being alone. Even though I don’t feel particularly suicidal right now, i’m shaking over the possibility of losing control.

Just another day :) - Trigger warning," It was a night like any other, she was alone after another shitty day of scraping by in a world that didn't notice her. One more piece of hay on the haystack of reasons she should end her life. Her eyes watered in relief as she slid the blade over the inside of her thighs. Each long bloody stream releasing the kick of endorphins she had become so dependent on. A slow smile pulled across her face as she felt the sting and the eventual numbing. Shivers ran through her arms followed by tingles, her back felt warm then her face started to flush.   

  
  Tears muddied her masquera as she looked to the blade in her fingers and then the mostly faint scars on her wrists. She sat the blade on the bedside table and traced the scars with her fingernail softly biting her lip. Part of her hoped she would find the strength to end the pain, to end the routine, to finally rest.   

  
  She remembered the last time she tried. The trip to the hospital, the strangers that gawked as they walked past her room, the man that touched her when and where he shouldn't. The facebook status her mom made about prayers for the family and 'their' hardship. The doctors talking to everyone but her. She was barely seen, and definitely not heard. 

  
  She saw the blank black screen sitting next to the bloodied razor and picked it up. It felt right to leave a goodbye, but to and for who? Instinctively she opened the phone to reddit. She typed the post looking for something, anything, or maybe nothing at all.",dark_tw,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ttg26s/just_another_day_trigger_warning/

Friendships and Relationships Make me Suicidal,"Friendships/relationships are one of the biggest jokes in the entire world. I've had friends of multiple years all of a sudden leave me cause ''they didn't see me the same way anymore'' or ''they wanna move on'' or they went through a change or something. I will always be replaced by someone better. 90% of relationships are based on hot looks, lust, manipulating someone for personal desires, money, fame, etc. No one has ever loved me for myself and only lustful desires. I'm done trusting everyone, people are so evil and I am way too paranoid of being blackmailed or betrayed/backstabbed for a petty reason. I lost my soulmate of almost 7 years... what a joke friendships are. It's all about saying bs lines to manipulate that persons emotions and then replacing them when someone better comes along. The chance of finding a true love/friend is rarer than winning the lottery. I'm honestly done and I guess I'll be alone forever.

I Want to Die but Can’t Bring Myself to Do It,"I’m 23/m and I’ve done things I deeply regret and am ashamed of. I was struggling with a porn addiction that led me to places I didn’t want to go and see things I wouldn’t have normally sought out. Things like incest, rape, even animals. I feel so fucking bad. I know deep down I’m a good person, but I’ve done things I can’t forgive myself for, and I don’t believe I should be. It’s shattered my perception of myself, this dichotomy of who I am deep down and the stuff I’ve done. I’ve thought about committing suicide for what I did to myself, but I know it would break my family’s hearts. I’ve known a lot of people who have committed suicide or died young and have seen the toll it takes on their loved ones, and I just can’t bring myself to do it. Even when I’m in so much pain I put other people before myself. Which makes it so much worse. Why didn’t I see why what I was doing was wrong? I’ve thought about running away, but I don’t know where I would go. I know I should just tell somebody but the shame is killing me. I’m scared that they’ll (rightfully) think I’m a monster. Everyone I’ve ever known in my life would say that I’m a good person and a great friend, which makes it so much worse living with my mistakes. Knowing that if they ever found out, that they would be so let down. I can’t live with this. I just want to be happy again and I don’t know how. I don’t know how to let go of the guilt. I don’t want anybody to think I’m a monster.

I am beside myself that I’ve spent so much of my time caring and tending to others, and when I need them, not a soul to be found. This loneliness is aching. I have been alone most of my life.

I keep trying to change my view from depressed to suicidal without self preservation but damn that’s hard. Sure my parents might miss me but they’re old and already lost a child so they’ve got some practice in the mourning department. I think it’s time to jump from a parking ramp.

Fortunately, they did, but now I'm feeling myself becoming angry at myself for seeking help, and angry at them for caring about me.

It almost feels like I'm swerving between the more rational me that wants help, and this version of me that is obsessed with trying to prove how suicide is justified and the only sane option.

"I'm so tired, it hurts every day I'm still alive","I feel so tired of living like this, alone with no friends, no  one to love, with a family that you care so little to nothing. I dont have any taste for anything, no hobbies or joy in anything anymore. 

I wake up with panic attacks, my body hurts physically for no reason, I feel touch starve, and I have punch to many walls to count. I'm jobless and living with my sister for the time being, and my family might as well be strangers at this point. I dont like anybody, I feel irritated all the time and the idea of working endlessly just to be stuck in the same place forever scares me more then knowing I'll die.

I have a plan for my death but might take a while, I need a gun first which I'll be getting one with my dad since he needs to go to the armory to get his own gun check and also to help me buy one. Easy since he is oblivious to my problems not that I want him to know it. Next is deciding where to go, I like to killmyself some place more natural or open and empty. I'm thinking of going on a road trip for places like the great canyon or other national parks. I dont have any desire to keep living a life I know will lead to lonelyness and nothingness. I want to end it. I just need the courage and motivation to do it, which is hard when you suffer from depression.

I just know that I don't have much money, so if I commit I can't backdown anymore.

Hopefully I'll have fun on the road before hand, don't want to leave this world without enjoying what I wanted to do when I came to this country, living on the road and becoming a road nomad. Though without money or a job that gets you that is impossible and would lead to disaster.

Been depressed for a while. Chronically suicidal all week. What should I do to get immediate help?,"I’ve posted here before in my previous attempts, and luckily, I made it out safe, know that I do want to at least try to live beyond 30. That still doesn’t stop my mind from going there often.

This week has been a challenge. I recently got a diagnosis of ADHD and it’s been helping me to finally have energy during the day and motivation to improve my life, at least until recently. My mind is the one that blocks me and makes everything unbearable. 

Thoughts about how I am in a job I’m not even passionate about anymore and just wasting everyone’s time. I have one close friend who I love with all my heart, but I know she can’t handle the constant heavy stuff I deal with (I lost friends due to opening up to them once and just vowed to only talk about this stuff with a therapist.) I have no one else basically. 

My mom is also as mentally ill as I am, so her seeing me go through this is putting a lot of guilt in me.  And there’s the fact that a grandchild from my brother is coming, and I can’t help but think this is the sign. This is the chance for me to talk my leave. But I understand that just offing myself is going to hurt my family and one friend so much.

So here’s where I’m at: i have a half-thought out plan. I REALLY DON’T want to die, but the mental pain is so unbearable i don’t know how to control. Telling my family and friend about this is only going to make me feel guilty/worse. I work as a para at a high school in Texas and have maybe one sick day left. I’m waiting till my contract is out and then I’ll formally quit and look for other opportunities. 

I’m considering going to a mental hospital to check myself in so I don’t actually go through it. Would I be fired if they found out/have to tell them if I stay there for longer than expected? How does it usually go when checking yourself in for suicidal thoughts from anyone’s experience (from TX would really help)? Researching has only given me vague answers and I don’t know if I’ll just lose my job/paycheck because I’m scared. How do I even tell my mom that I’m driving myself to a clinic because I’m scared I might run off and die without giving her a panic attack? 

I’m waiting till a few hours from now to decide my next action. Maybe these thoughts will go away by them, but future reference may help me later if it ever comes up again.

I want to end it,"I am 22 yrs old. I have been through a series of shit in my life, as I’m sure anyone who is apart of this group has. I want to share with you all my experiences so that I can see if it’s worth living anymore. I was 3 yrs old when my innocence was taken from me, 3 yrs old where I found myself alone. What’s crazy is I remember everything that happened. And when I told my mother, someone who is supposed to protect me, she said it happened to her too and that we’d have to keep it a secret. A secret from my father, siblings, and grandmother you name it. Nobody could know. That’s where my trust was broken for the first time. I went through the ages from 3-13 of being molested by my grandfather and I said nothing. I never said anything because when I tried it didn’t work the first time. I also grew up seeing my family become alcoholics and drug addicts. Coke, Heroin, and Meth. Whenever I confronted my siblings or parents for doing said drugs they would deny and dismiss me, making me feel like a crazy kid that no one would believe. I’ve also seen abuse. My dad hitting my mom, my dad getting into bloody fights, my sisters being abused by their boyfriends, aunts and uncles fighting. I just never caught a break. Then to hear almost all the women in my family were molested. BY THE SAME MAN. And no one did a damn thing about it. It was crazy to me. But I am no better for never speaking up. When I finally got the courage to tell my father what happened he sat in silence. Looked at me and said “Fuck… I’m sorry that happened to you” then he walked away. My dad was also molested and raped as a child so I know what feelings crossed his and my mothers minds when I brought that up. But yet, that wasn’t the reaction I was hoping for…. I went through my teen years looking for love, a connection with any person willing to give it. But it was always the same outcome. Date, sex, get dumped or cheated on. I started smoking and binge drinking and eating a lot, making myself throw up and all for what? For love? No, I shortly found out it was because I have never ever loved myself. And still till this day I do not. I am Married now, for 2 yrs. And he loves me and I love him. But I am starting to see the toxicity in our relationship. We both gaslight each other and we both say hurtful things to each other sometimes. It’s never got physical but I’m scared that I’ll end up like my mother. A door mat. I have tried to put my all into us working out but there’s no trust between us anymore. There’s no spark like there used to be. And I feel stuck. I don’t want to leave and try to find love with someone again because I’ve never felt this way about someone before. I have slowly come to realize I can’t be saved and I can no longer save myself. I want to Die. I want to just sleep and never wake up. I want to find the courage to hang my self or cut my wrists or shoot my self in the head and end it all. But I haven’t found the guts to do it. I’m scared of the pain but I can’t stand what I’m feeling everyday with just being me. It’s not working. I cannot find the will to stay alive anymore, for 12 long yrs I just lost the fight and I don’t want to continue. But I don’t want to hurt those around me because I always put them before me.

Im just spent. Im tired of trying to do things.,"I just got done from a first day orientation at a job i was offered. Min wage to be a warehouse assistant at a air filter company. I have college, i have multiple safety tickets, i have three years of warehouse management experience. This is the only interview I’ve gotten after months of searching. 

I get there and the entire day for orientation they are telling me how im going out to service air filters instead of being a warehouse worker. I was going to have to drive a boxtruck ive never drove before two hours away to a location ive never been to. To meet people ive never met to do a job ive never done. I have a pretty intense anxiety disorder and felt like I was about to have a panic attack with everything going on. I had been straight up lied to. And I decided to go home instead of to the registry to get my drivers abstract for them as I personally felt the company was unsafe and I was very uncomfortable. 

Im currently back at my parents and i get to gear how much of a deadweight i am. A freeloader. A spoiled brat. This didn’t get better today as my first job in three months i quit after not even a day. My dad tore into me about how useless i am. And i get it I really don’t do much anymore. But ive never refused to help out for him. Ive built his business website for no charge and I update and maintain it. I put in four hours a day on the farm for him without a complaint. And i kind of just broke today. I yelled at him alot and just got back in my car and drove off. I dont know if I should even go home but I dont know what to do anymore.

My entire life has been a constant struggle. My first suicide attempt was when I was 9 years old and my parents put me in a mental facility where i was horrifically abused by the other patients there. Ive never had a safe space as my parents removed all the locks from the rooms in the house as I would lock the door to get away from them. I remember them calling the police on me when i was 11 because i had found a way to lock the bathroom on them and they were upset at me. 

Im just tired. Ive tried therapy and spent easily 4000$ on it in the last two years alone. The first therapist said my issue is i didnt have god and the second one worked with my doctor and got me diagnosed me with OCD and depression after awhile and then stopped returning my emails to schedule a new appointment shortly after. 

Im just really tired of being taken advantage of all the time. I feel like I had to do something to deserve the life i have and i try really hard to do good things. I regularly volunteer and I’ve paid friends bills when they are short without asking for money back. I try to put good out in the world alot but I feel like I have no chance at anything anymore. I don’t know what to do anymore. I just feel maxed out at life.

A philosophical question,"I will preface this by saying I would rather be dead than alive (you can see my last post here in my post history, or even my mess of a post history in general).  


Why is suicide such a taboo and frowned upon decision?  


If someone is so depressed and hopeless and suffering why should they not be allowed to take their own lives? Take me for example. I have no intention of getting a job, contributing to society, going to school etc. and I insist that I flat out do not want to live (for reasons that are covered on my earlier post) and I am suffering, so why do people insist I should live? Is it that they are just virtue signaling?  


The fact of the matter is, we all die eventually. Some of us are able to feel happiness in life, while others are not. When animals are suffering, they are mercifully euthanized. But when we are suffering either via physical or emotionally/mentally, we have to just tough it out? Other than being forced to be a wage slave, what benefit are we to society if we suffer?   


Obviously, no one should be pressured into forfeiting their life and the decision to be able to forfeit their own life should be left in the hand of the one living their life, but on that same token, no one should be forced to live a life they don't want. We didn't ask to be brought in this world, there we shouldn't have any obligation to remain in it.",LifeBytes123,13,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tt9mqo/a_philosophical_question/

Irrational thought,"Does anybody else get angry at the thought of being put here without consent?

Wouldn't mind disappearing,"   I'm just really really tired of dealing with myself. I'm so stupid its funny. I am unable to control the way I feel, I can't even hide it. I wouldn't complain if I just felt in silence without any need to talk but its damaging pretty much everything.

   I'm a very chatty person, its hard for me to stay silent about things. And I really can't hide the way I feel. I start to sort of ""spaz"" out and just pretending I'm not upset when its obvious.

   I also have even tried manipulating conversations so the other person would ask how I feel and what they can do to help. I crave attention so badly. Its good that I try to stop myself when I notice my manipulative behaviors.

"I’ve ruined my own life, I’m isolated, and I think I’m ready to do it.","I can’t put it all down here. I’ve ruined my relationship with my mother, I’m a disappointment, I’m failing freshman year of college, I’m isolated, I’m ugly, none of my projects or pursuits are working out, I feel numb, I’m disgusted with myself, and it’s my own fault.  I feel like I deserve this.  I can’t keep being a burden to my family. I have no friends.  I’m alone and can’t talk to anyone. I embarrass my family. I’m a failure.  My hygiene is deteriorating. I haven’t brushed my teeth in weeks, my hair is greasy, I can’t sleep or I sleep too much. It’s embarrassing how awfully I handle everything that happens to me.  

I got drunk for the first time on spring break.  A drunk man offered to sleep with me, I didn’t go for it. I told my roommate about it.  She laughed and said I should have gone for it, because no one else would ever be stupid enough to sleep with me. I can’t stop thinking about it.

I want to be mad at my parents for disliking me but it’s all my fault and I don’t mean that for attention, it’s just that it is. I’m abrasive and unmotivated and the shame I feel being myself is too much now.  My face is red all the time because I’m so flushed with shame.  I feel swollen.  Pathetic. I want to crawl away and die and I want everyone I’ve ever met to forget me.  I’m so sorry to everyone I’ve hurt. I can’t take it back but I can prevent it going forward.

I go to a state university and my house is thirty minutes away. Incidentally, the attic in that house has a door to it which is accessible through my bedroom only.  There’s a huge beam running horizontally across the upper space of the attic.  If I open that door and stand on my tip toes I can reach the beam.  There’s about a two foot drop from the floor of my room down into the attic space.  I’ve tested it and the beam holds my weight.  I can dangle from it with both arms fully extended and my feet don’t come close to touching the ground. I’m going to hang myself from that beam soon.  Before the semester’s up.  I’m so sorry but I’m tired of waiting and I can’t be like this anymore.  I’ve tried to change and I can’t.  I don’t even know what’s wrong with me.  I can’t do anything I like anymore.  Even if I try to read a book or play a game, it doesn’t matter anymore, I feel nothing, enjoy nothing.  I feel like someone died inside me and Im moving around their body.

I would have just run my car off the road but I can’t imagine putting my family in that kind of financial situation.  I’ll leave a note.  I hope when they die it all goes quick and that they don’t have a funeral.  I’ll clean up before I go and make sure it’s easy to pack my stuff.  I hope it gets donated to someone who needs stuff.

It’s hard to keep going,"I survived an attempt about 6 years ago now. I got out of the bad environment I was in, moved to the city on my own, finished my degrees, got a job, a partner (now fiancé), and I am succeeding. I’ve gained weight during covid, and my health isn’t the best, but other than that I am “doing well”. I get up and do my work, sometimes push myself too hard but I manage a fairly medium lifestyle now. My
place is a little bit messy, but not the worst. My social life is mediocre. Everything feels mediocre except for my animation job which honestly feels like one of the only reasons I am alive. 

However, even though I have come this far, and have been managing my depression symptoms, I have not been ok. I’ve become so good at masking that people don’t suspect anything, but it also feels like no one cares when I retreat and start to struggle. I self harm from time to time, and I still have suicidal thoughts very often. 

It’s the most confusing, tiring thing in the world to have worked so hard yet not feel any better. I am exhausted mentally, physically, emotionally. Socialising makes me extremely low, but so does being alone. All of the things I ever enjoyed just feel like work. It all feels like work and I’m so scared I will never feel ok again. 

Does anyone else feel this way? That the depression is there and just as bad as ever, but you “function” and therefore feel like you’re unworthy for help. Like doctors don’t take you seriously if you’re not bashing your head against a wall in front of them or putting on a show. I even showed them my self harm because I needed them to help dress it, but it was just really dry interactions. It feels like I’m too old now to struggle even though I’m 26. It feels like everyone expects the world of me because I set such a high standard. I’ve always been thrown in the deep end so that’s just what I got used to. What they don’t realise is that working hard is a coping mechanism. The success is tainted. Reaching out is so hard, but even when I do people tell me I’m the only one responsible for my feelings and life. And I know that, and I do, but the compassion and care would be nice, you know? I’m doing my best despite facing this every single day. 

I don’t even know if this is making sense. Or the point of this. I guess I’m just frustrated that I still have those suicidal thoughts and impulse when I am technically doing better. Even my first attempt, when I was released from hospital I sat outside alone crying because I had no one to come pick me up.",plzstopamfragile,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tt0q2p/its_hard_to_keep_going/

Seriously considering suicide due to an awful situation and desperately need advice,"Hi, thanks for reading. I know this is not an advice sub but I desperately need some from a stranger. Any really.

(post below)

Not sure if I was sexually coerced abroad (19m), think I have an STD - may have passed it onto my girlfriend (20). Please help.

I’ll just start with the fact that this is probably the most difficult thing that has happened to me in my life. I have had nightmares for two weeks since the event and I can’t get any sleep; my daylight hours are consumed with guilt and I am seriously considering suicide. (Have written a note, and made a rough timeframe).

I was recently on holiday in Havana, and was searching for food alone around 1am, very intoxicated. For those who know Havana - there is a street where prostitutes hang out, unfortunately its one of the only places you can get a pizza that late. Here is where it gets blurry - I remember walking back to my apartment and being approached by three prostitutes. They brought me to someones bed (not mine) where i remember receiving fellatio (cant remember if there was a condom). I remember having an erection but being unable to finish. I barely remember getting home, but I still had my phone and wallet but when I checked in the morning my wallet was missing all its cash (around 60 euros).

I’m not sure it was not consensual. I did not report the event to police because i’m not sure 1) they would do anything 2) I have desperately tried to forget it ever happened. I love my girlfriend more than anyone in the world and tried to forget it happened but I cannot. She means so much to me and I’d never thought of cheating before but I just can’t remember my thought process no matter how many times I relive it. I’m so scared that I consented. I know that I’m responsible for the actions of drunk me.

Recently my testicles have started itching more than usual and sometimes it stings slightly to pee (no redness). I have had sex with my girlfriend within the time I got back (with a condom vaginally, but not orally) as I didn’t want her to know what happened and think I cheated. I feel really really awful knowing that I could have passed this disease on to her and all I want is for her to be alright. To me suicide seems like the only plausible way out, as I can’t see myself living life without her and this will undoubtedly fundamentally change how she sees me.

I don’t know what to do… Any advice would be appreciated, shit or not.",thekingkong02,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tt5ztf/seriously_considering_suicide_due_to_an_awful/

I have a terrible condition and i just cant live with it,"M23. Somewhere in the neck something blocks my veins and i feel horrible pressure in my head because of it. I dont have any other side effects other than unbearable pain and being very uncomfortable almost all the time. Ive had it for almost a year, ive went to doctors, checked myself, done some MRI, did excercises, nothing ever worked out. I dont see any sense in this life even living healthy, now u can imagine how terrible it is to go through when life is just physically painful. Ive gotta tell that this pain changed me a lot this years, ive started to appreciate little things life, to be more empathetic, become much more down to earth, while i was never narcissistic in any way but whatever. Ive got a tons of amazing music that kept me going, i was literally listening music all my life, maybe its the only thing that got me through this life that far because i dont know where else i would find any motivation or desire to continue this miserable life. Ive spent last 7 years mostly sitting at home watching YouTube, movies and playing poker, ive not been to any parties, ive never done anything crazy or active. Last summer i spent in countryside house and ive realised that this is exactly what i want for the rest of my life. I want nature, i want to hear birds when i wake up, i want to ride a bike on max speed while blasting some Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson or breakbeat on speakers, to ride into the sunsets, to spend the nights in a forests, to be in the nature and feel it. I started to truly hate the city life, internet, social medias, all this fucking mainstream lifestyle, career, job. Jobs always screwed me over no matter how loyal i was, and that was my biggest mistake ever fucking working for someone.

And like even if i was healthy, even if i had the money, even if i spent my whole life in the nature as i planned, whats the fucking point anyways? I really feel like spiritually or idk logically i realised everything about this life that i need to know. Like i already feel like i know enough so that i can just die and move to some other dimension in the afterlife if it exists. Like i feel like i dont need to go through this life anymore like i wont gain anything, and whats the point in materialism if u lose everything when u die. I feel like my suicide would be completely justified because this fucking pressure in my head is really very very annoying and i somehow managed to live a decent year with it but i just dont see why i should live with this ""disability"" when everybody around is just healthy, why should i life the same life but with this fucking bullshit?",Simply_electrifying7,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tt7y6y/i_have_a_terrible_condition_and_i_just_cant_live/

I made my suicide note. this is the first place i'll show it,"I probabily won't kill myself tonight but I almost did.

(Suicide note)

If you're reading this, then I have killed myself. 

Over several years I have been suicidal, never could really tell even to myself if I was going to commit suicide or just let it simmer in my mind. 

Everything has been building up throughout my whole life that has caused to my suicide. 

I witnessed - Domestic Abuse between the ages of 4 &amp; 5. The things I saw and the things I overheard, I can't ever forget. It's always in my mind; it never leaves me. 

I was sexually abused at the age of 6, this was only a one time occurence, however, just happening once has traumatised me once again just like the domestic abuse i've witnessed it never leaves me. 

I witness someone die when I was 10, I was simply walking to school and just by chance I saw this, I wouldn't say it traumatised me but I would say it opened my eyes to the point of life and that there is no point simply we are a chemical formation that happened by the slimest chance that will die eventually so why bother? 

I am a nihilist, I mean, why wouldn't I be an nihilist there is literally no point for anything. To qoute a song - ""Born with nothing, Die with everything."" 

It doesn't just end with the things I've seen that I cannot unsee. My family is fucked, there is no other word to describe it. My whole dad's side of the family either do not know I exsist or chose to not see me; that inludes my dad.
More than halve of the family on my mums side despises me, do you want to know why? Simply because I was born. 
My birth was quite controversial for my family, My father had an affair with my mum's sister Stacey. And decided to dis-own me.
I have an Older half/brother and 2 younger Half/brother's and 1 Half/sister from my father's side. He see all of them, apart from me. Infact I have contacted my Dad twice in the past, one was when I was 11. All I said was ""Hi"" and the response I recieved was ""you was a mistake"" and then he blocked me and the second time I contacted him, I was drunk, I was 16 and I called him a ""twat"". 

It doesn't just end there with my family. My grandma and grandpa told my mum that she was either to have an abortion or to send me upto them in Scotland, without even being born. I was hated.
My Nan used me as a baby to get at my mum, How do I know this? My mum told me. My nan tried to claim ownership of me because she thought my mum was an unfit parent, In reality she only wanted to do it to get at my mum. How do you think I feel when I found out I was used as a tool? 

My mum has gone off the rails to me a few times in the past and when she does it is usually quite bad, she says hurtful things. Most of the time it is justified, I remember that she asked me to go to the shops but I really didn't want to so in return she started screaming at me, calling me pathetic, she used words as if it was violence.  
Today, was different. My sister ate a portion of my food and to be honest I didn't really care. I don't eat much anymore. She decided to shout at Lacey which didn't get anywhere. But for some reason she decided to shout at me. When I quite literally did nothing wrong, i do stress that I am being 100% honest when I say I did nothing wrong. I am honest, I own up when I do something, but this time I didn't do anything.
She decided to shout and scream at me and walk closer to me whilst in my face and pointing her finger at me, I was backed into the corner of the room. This was when she decided to try and punch me in the face, I dodged it and then I shouted at her ""do it again"" ""get away from me"" ""why did you try to attack me"" this was when my step-dad came down. This was when my mum decided to not shout and act like the victim, she questioned me that she never attempted to hit me, Naturally Carl was on her side. 
I never felt so alone in my life, my own Mother lying about that she tried to attack me just to make herself look like the victim. I mean it is nothing new. But this was different. 

I almost killed myself if it wasn't for my Girlfriend, if she wasn't in my life then by the date of (31/03/22) would have been my suicide. 
I know that I would eventually give in the urges to kill myself are getting stronger and I feel weaker to stop it.
Whatever pushes me to that point, I hope that it was worth it.",not-a-throw-away--,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ttbsxu/i_made_my_suicide_note_this_is_the_first_place/

I think it's time to start planning...,"I have to say I’m a bit conflicted. I am still hopeless for sure. There are things that are definitely better in terms of life like how I just got new pillows so my neck doesn't hurt as much when I sleep, but overall I’m still just not set on living or having a future anymore.

I’m afraid that I don’t have thes trength to carry on. I’m sad I think I won’t ever be able to get better.

I think it’s time to start planning.

Everyone is just slowly getting sick of me and I’ve been sick of me for a while now so I don’t think here’s any hope with saving me at this point.

I used to have dreams and aspirations you know, I used to want to live and do things be BE someone. Not anymore.

Everyone keeps talking about my future and how I have to pick myself up and start focusing on my future. I don’t have the heart to tell them I can’t even start with that because I don’t see a future for myself.

I don’t see a feasible future for myself and I’m just so tired honestly.

It’s even more so depressing because I know I’m depressed and suicidal and I don’t wanna live anymore so I wanna disappear but at the same time I don’t even have the guts to end my own life.

It’s frustrating as fuck knowing you’re a disappointment and a POS through and through.

Ever since mum died I’ve just stopped living. I exist yeah, but I’m not alive, not really.

The years before she passed I think I’ve become so focused on taking care of her and being with her that she became my life, because honestly noone else was there for me except her. Sure I had my older brothers, my estranged dad that’s homophobic and faults me and my sexuality as the casue of me getting sexually assaulted by 3 men when I was 13. But I feel no familial connection with them, they’re merely people I happened to end up with in this life. Now that mum’s passed away I don’t have anything or anyone to live for.

I have no dreams, no aspirations, or goals. Passions I used to have mean nothing to me now I’m just a shell of who or what I used to be.

To be completely honest, in my 22 years of life I can’t remember the last time I was genuinely happy. It sucks that I feel this way but itt’s even more frustrating being this self aware that I’m messed up, I know why I’m messed up, how things happened, why I feel the way I do. but it’s gotten so bad I can’t even begin to want to get better anymore.

I’m hanging on by a thread and I feel like it’s so close to snapping and this is my last cry for help, I guess.",throwawayfordayz93,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ttbdy4/i_think_its_time_to_start_planning/
The desire to keep going (Thank you 🙏),"Dear reddit users,

I just want to say thankyou for helping me today, ive been really stupid and was planning on ending my life, even going as far as to enquire on r/heroin about how much I'd need for an overdose. Kind of ironic to be born into this world on such a drug only to leave on the same thing.

But after speaking with people there, here and my partner in Hungary. Something in me changed, I realized that all of this internalised pain and suffering. Was keeping me from progressing forward, while that sounds like a no-brainer. At the time it didn't quite register, that said this isn't what changed my mind.

Ive been quite irritable with my partner lately and have been pretty nasty and awful towards her, it was this coupled with the fact that I just need to keep busy and maybe have a hobby that finally made me see sense. Yes im still facing the same problems as before, the same fears and the same struggles. But now im ready to face them instead of running away.

Thankyou to all who have reached out and hopefully, this can be the start of something much more positive. Thankyou all and big hugs 💜",misshollykaizen,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tt1d50/the_desire_to_keep_going_thank_you/
My anxiety has consumed me.,"I've been struggling with my mental health for as long as I can remember. First it started as mild social anxiety. The fear of socialization led me to isolate myself. That isolation caused my first depressive episode. Years later, I have a disorder called hypochondria (health anxiety). This causes me to always think there is something seriously wrong with my body. Like at any moment I will be diagnosed with terminal cancer, or my heart will suddenly stop. This mixed with OCD and depression has caused me to go insane. I am on a decent dose of Zoloft and it has done nothing for me. I've tried therapy, medication, and all of the self help exercises. It feels like this is something medication won't be able to fix. There is no point in checking myself into a psychiatric hospital, since all they will do is get me stable on medication that most likely will not work. I no longer have goals or aspirations. There is nothing I am looking forward to in life. I haven't felt happy in a very long time. There is no point in living like this. I don't know what to do. No one in my life cares about my mental health anymore. I have been talking about it for so long that it doesn't worry anyone anymore. I have tried everything to stop this hell. Every minute of every day I am worried about something. I have a difficult time sleeping as well. I am too scared to actually commit. I don't want my family to have to deal with my death. Death would be the easy way out for me. Though, it will cause pain to those I care about. That pains me to think about.

Life After Suicide,"For myself and others, I’m sure part of the reason we think of suicide is so people will care after we pass. I know for me personally, I think often “maybe they’ll finally care if I’m gone”, however I really have no way of knowing that and neither does anyone else in theory.

I’ve had a fair share amount of suicides in my life and I’ve even watched somebody attempt to take their life. I’ve seen the grief it causes, I’ve felt a certain level of said grief, yet at the end of the day life goes on.

Feeling su1c1dal. idek what's happening,"TW: // h*mophobia, mention of getting st@bbed.

I'm just going through really hard time. I don't even know what to say about it. 

But yesterday i felt really suicidal. I never felt this much of suicidal before. 

I recently was diagnosed with ADHD-C, and everything made sense in life. But my parents are still not understanding about how mentally tolling it can be. I told my parents that have been feeling burnout for past 9 months and they just seem to take it lightly. I was in depression, and always had chronic anxiety issues which were all fueled by my untreated and undetected ADHD for all these years. 

My parents are actually really nice and always encourage me to open up, but it's all stupid because they end up blaming me for not trying harder. My anxiety which I had since I was kid always made it difficult for me to have friends. I do not even have siblings to share stuff with. 

I cannot share or talk about my problems that are actually troubling me to my parents with complete honesty because they don't understand and end up telling me to fix my schedule or some stupid shit that definitely wouldn't work for adhd minds. 
Because of that i atleast try to gain comfort from them by talking about other stuff that gives me pleasure like talking about favourite serie or charecter, but they ALWAYS tell me that I'm getting distracted again, and that should delete my Social media and stuff. 

Also yesterday, i asked my mom if, she  would accompany to pride parade if that happened in our city. And she started nagging, ""i told you to delete Instagram, you are supposed to study,.... Delete that rn!"" which clearly shows that she was trying to avoid that talk. So I'm really not left with a space where can talk about anything comfortably with them. The fact that she is internally h*mophobic puts me through so much stress. And everytime I talk about something deep, it always ends up with her telling me to study. I teared up. My dad, is mostly unavailable at home because of his work, all we do is little chit chat. And never had a chance to talk deeply about my personal issues, like i can do with my mom (who's housewife) even tho that doesn't end up well. 

Since I took an academic gap year, all my friends already promoted to next year's classes, left city and i have completely lost contact with them. Its been two years since i haven't really went outside to fresh my mind and enjoy myself. I can't do that, because my parents don't allow me to go anywhere alone and I don't even have a valid reason to.

Also I'm realising that even tho my parents have been always nice to me, they are always restricting my freedom. I'm F18 for godsake, and i still don't have control over my decisions. They are mostly made on my behalf by my mom. I can't even recharge my Mobile plans, i have to ask my mom every time to do it. And she would always excuse that ""it's waste of money use wifi instead"" and say ""you don't call or get calls from your friends anyway"". Like, sure wifi works but that'd mean i can't really go outside since i struggle with anxiety and always need music to cope. I don't even know details of my own band acc or cards, and so I can't do something on my own without asking my parents about it. This all might sound ridiculous but i really don't know any other way to cope. 


And so my coping options were reduced to my alone time in my room which helps me organise my intrusive thoughts, nice people on instagram, reddit forums and music. 


But yesterday, these all were breached. My parents are not emotionally supportive, unsafe to confide in and almost indifferent to my ADHD situation even tho they atleast provide with meds. I'm not on therapys. I do not have friends. My mom's homophobic undertone when i tried to seek least bit of comfort is just so hurtful. The wifi wasn't working well and my mom refused to recharge my phone, which meant no music, reddit or Instagram which gives me best comfort space i can afford.  And my parents intruded in my personal space yesterday which is crucial to me especially when i feel unstable and wanted to write my thoughts down privately. 

I went to bathroom and cried. And next thing that came to my mind was to go upstairs on terrace and then kiss the ground. Right before when i slept at 4:45am (i have very shitty sleep schedule bec of my adhd) i saw a flash in head where someone st@bbed me in my stomach and then hugged me, and i felt great and said ""thank you, this feels awesome"". I was kinda horrified and mad at myself for having such stupid intrusive thought. I woke up late today at 11am,  and was veryy tired and felt like i would collapse any second. Slept for another 2½ hours and saw a dream where i told my mom to kill me. And then she got mad at me for always talking about negetive stuff. I woke up feeling half dead. 

So yeah this all happened. And- idek where am I supposed to go.. .

I subconsciously keep hoping to die of natural causes or somehow go into vegetative state. 

Half of my problems would have been solved if i didn't have ADHD. Having no true safe space makes living just even more difficult.",spicytacoburryto,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tt2l6g/feeling_su1c1dal_idek_whats_happening/

unsure of how to cope,"Over the last 6 months the desire to die has been strong.  I have battled with this and worked with a psychiatrist.

Over the last 18 years it has been one thing after another  where their health and well-being is concerned. I am supposed to once again step up and be strong.  I don't want to. I want to give up. When I spoke to my old psychologist on Sunday she tried to tell me I would leave people with a sense of guilt if I did go through with it. I hate this. I saw the psychiatrist tonight and I think he understands how crap I feel but what can he do. Trying new medication but not really helping very much. I have been the strong person for so many years.

Not sure if actually suicidal or just addicted to doomscrolling,"I've been having some occasional suicidal thoughts ever since puberty hit, but it's only gotten really intense recently. I'm 20 now and I've spent the last few weeks scrolling through suicide related subreddits, reading depressing crap all day and wallowing in self-pity.

I'm reading so many suicide-related posts partly just to pass the time and partly because it's nice to be able to relate to people online. But I'm not sure if I actually want to kill myself. Yes, I want to die. Yes, I'm tired of life. But I've never actually gone past the point of contemplating suicide, never actually made concrete plans let alone chosen a specific method I want to pursue one day. Nothing. Just thoughts and hypothetical scenarios.

I feel like a coward for being like this. Sometimes I think to myself ""why don't you just do it?"" and I feel like a loser who can't do anything, not even end his own life even though he wants to. Does anyone relate?

"While losing hope that I’ll ever have a “redemption arc” for my life, how can I make life feel more worth living?","I don’t wanna kill myself. I can actually be frustratingly stuck in between “not wanting to kill myself, but wanting to die” too much of the time. I’m afraid of death, and I’m too afraid to go through with any of the methods to kill myself. I don’t wanna be in any pain or risk not successfully dying. 

But, I’m so tired of waiting for the day when God or something sees that I’ve “suffered enough” to deserve my life turning around. You hear about this sort of thing a lot in stories of recoveries, or even stories of how famous people GOT famous. They hit their lowest lows, and then things turn around. I feel like I’ve been at my lowest lows countless times, but the best I get is that things return to whatever low norm they were at the next day, except I’m not sobbing about it anymore.

I’m so bored with how I am. I want to do a lot more, but don’t know how. I’m so hungry for validation that I’ve tried to become known on social media numerous times, but it’s fallen flat and led me repeatedly to look like a sad try-hard. I don’t wanna care about what people think of me anymore, but it’s like it’s engrained in my DNA.

I miss everyone and miss having connections, but my social anxiety makes it to where I avoid everyone except my bf. I miss my family, but I can’t call because phone calls make me wanna crawl out of my skin. I don’t text as regularly as I need to, and I’m not sure why. I can’t become closer to people because I don’t feel natural around them. I’m scared of them, and need a comfort person around in order to not feel so awkward that I feel like crying.

I live with the constant feeling of obligation to make up for my shortcomings. For example, I worry about people I avoid due to social anxiety feeling like I hate them, so I feel the need to try to hang out with them all the time, or make some grand gesture to prove that I don’t. But, that just puts even more pressure on me all the time, and makes me feel even worse. 

I’m tired of trying to convince some family members that I still love and care for them, even if I have trouble keeping in touch. But, if I loved them so much, why do I keep having so much trouble? I can’t live with the guilt of this. It’s too much. They’ll die thinking I didn’t even like them that much. 

I don’t feel like I have a real purpose other than to be a sickly person that depends on and ruins other people. But, I also don’t wanna die. I’m actually worried that the way I’m living and eating will kill me, but it’s the only way I cope right now, and I won’t stop (yet). I don’t get it. Where’s the light at the end of the tunnel? Do I have to keep living like this? Do I have a choice anymore?",altaccounttohide,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tt61cr/while_losing_hope_that_ill_ever_have_a_redemption/

sick and at my wits end,"I’m trying to think logically. I almost got up and started writing (picking up from last time I wrote one) my suicide note to my friends and family. I’m trying so hard to think about them since I know how much pain I would be putting them in.
It’s so fucking hard. I’m so fucking tired. I have 4 chronic illnesses and deal with painful and sickness daily and I’m not even 18 yet. I’m suffering so much with this and they’re all incurable. I want to let go and have my freedom again. To be able to actually fall asleep and stay asleep, to be able eat normally. To be able to do anything I want without nearly collapsing daily. To be out of this body and in one that at least doesn’t have all that I have. 

Please don’t try to give me false hope. One of the things people who aren’t chronically ill need to learn is that telling someone who’s chronically ill that “it gets better” is completely pointless. I’m only getting worse, and getting more diagnoses. I’m so tired and barely hanging on, and anyone who loves me can thank whatever fucking GOD there is that my mom exists, because she is truly the only reason I’m here. I don’t want to cause them pain.

Being Forgotten,"People say that everyone will eventually become forgotten once they die, but what about becoming forgotten while being still alive? With each passing day, I am becoming a shadow in everyone's hearts.  I used to be a B student in secondary school who always tried to be excel in every subject. Everyone around me thought that I was an ambitious individual who would achieve great things in life. So what have I achieved so far? Sure, I have a collection of fancy awards, two medals, and such, but even my accomplishments will become forgotten one day. Currently, I am sitting at my desk, contemplating my entire existence. From the outside, it seems like I have a perfect life. I am 19 years of age, I have a house to live in, wonderful parents, and, most importantly, that one friend who I can count on in every situation. I have everything, yet I have nothing. In September I will be attending college for Business Studies, ideally, I would love to study philosophy or literature, but the world's best degrees are medicine, business, and computer science. I was a student who loved attending classes, I was always motivated by teachers, and for me, they were my idols, always offering advice, always there to listen. Now that I am no longer in school,  I have no one to motivate me. I am all on my own. 

My days are made up of reading philosophy (nihilism and absurdism) and reading poets such as Plath, Sexton, and Poe. As a student, I was the biggest optimist in my school, always cheerful, always hopeful. Now everyone tells me that I am the biggest pessimist they have met. I became careless, awfully honest, selfish, and utterly unthankful. I have everything I could have ever asked for. I have an amazing room, a gaming PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch, and other things. In other words, I can have anything I want, but all I desire is to leave this Earth. I have someone in my life who is willing to teach me how to invest money and offer me advice, yet I remain unthankful. I am a person who can never be satisfied with anything. I see problems and obstacles everywhere. I am no longer that student with a growth mindset who always sees an opportunity in a difficult situation, I am a person who sees pure nothingness in every opportunity. For years I have dealt with maladaptive daydreaming. I made an alternative reality in my own mind, and now that I have to face real life, the alternative reality that I made, is in conflict with the real world. I don't longer feel myself, I dissociate constantly and I tend to avoid this harsh reality at all costs. From a young age, I also dealt with OCD. I went to two professionals, but no one was able to help me. Most of the days I am in a melancholic mood, and if not then I am mentally numb with no emotions. It's one or the other. 

I absolutely hate when people ask me about my future. People ask questions such as, ""what do you want to do in the future?"" To be truly honest, I would love to have a suicide pact with someone, but at the same time, I do not want to drag anyone down with me. I honestly think that life holds potential sources of beauty, but for me, all of this beauty has expired and is no longer accessible. It's like I am trying to put this beauty to good use, but all of the sources have expired. As I mentioned before, I am only 19 years of age. To be honest, for me this life feels like being placed on death row, waiting in a prison for years to receive the ultimate release. I no longer know what to do, waiting for death is the longest journey I have ever been faced with.

I'm starting to be less and less scared that I'm not scared at all,"Like a lot of you, I'm very lonely. 

Lonely enough that, lately, I've been taking walks to try and get my mind off things a bit. It's helping a little, and getting out there and just walking for miles and miles has been something to look forward to now for the first time in a long time. 

Thing is, there's a bridge that I like to stop at and rest. Every time I walk into it, and I stop, and I look down, I think about how easy it would be to just jump off into the water and be done with it all. It's high enough that it would definitely kill me. 

This morning, right as the sun was first starting to peek out, I started off on my walk. When I got to the bridge, I stopped for way too long - an hour maybe. After a while, it went from ""Maybe it might be okay"", to ""I'm sure it wouldn't be that bad"", to ""It would be over before you knew what hit you"". 

Then, strangely, a sudden feeling of acceptance came over me, and for the first time in years, I felt.. calm. At peace. That feeling unsettled me to the point of questioning my entire view on life, and now I'm getting day drunk at home and writing this down for whatever reason. To process it, I guess. 

I've been researching, and apparently once you jump, you immediately regret it, and the survivors tell of being so happy to be alive, that it was this cathartic moment and things have finally started to make sense. 

I'm finding that the more time I sit with it, the less daunting the whole thing is, and the more I think that letting go, free-falling, and resigning myself to whatever fate lies ahead might be the best thing I could do for myself. 

I either die with one last regret to deal with on the way down, or I live, and maybe have a newfound perspective on it all. 

Now, as I write all this down, and I'm getting progressively more drunk, I'm getting the feeling that one of these nice little walks might lead to a happy ending soon, and that makes me feel really, _really_ good inside.",thatskeletondude,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tt4jt5/im_starting_to_be_less_and_less_scared_that_im/

Struggling with intrusive thoughts for months now.,"I have Bipolar II and it made my life a living hell since i am diagnosed since early childhood. 
For 2 month's now im in a mayor depressive episode and I am hurting everyone in my life with it, i am not meditated since im not the legal age to make the decision myself to get the medication or not, and my mom is strongly against them.

I have been thinking for days now about just getting up one day, finishing school and just never coming home, but i don't want to leave my partner in such a misery of losing someone they love.
I have been slowly pushing him away with my mental health unconsciously and I decided if i lose him, the last person who cared about me, i basically lost everything in my life.
I never told him these toughts bc i don't want him to be under this pressure of staying with me just to keep me alive.

I hope if i get therapy again everything fixes, at last i can tell someone my problems.
The guilt is too much and i often find myself not talking to my friends bc i don't want to be a bother to them.

I just don't know how to help with these thoughts anymore, they are eating me and every relationship i have slowly.

Almost succeeded last night,I used a long sleeve shirt and tied it around my neck super tight hoping to cut off blood circulation to my brain. After about 15 seconds I lost control of my muscles and fell to the floor. I came close to losing consciousness but never did. And I know that's all it takes is to go unconscious. And after a few more minutes it would be the end. I just wonder why I never lost consciousness. I just want it to work.

I lied to my doctor today,"My doctor asked me some questions. One of them was ""Any active plans or recent thoughts of harming yourself?"" I said no, last time was 10 months ago. That was a lie. Last time was a &lt; month ago when I bought a rope and a stool (still in my car) and was 10 minutes away from the spot I was going to hang myself. But then I went home and didn't eat anything for 3 days. They know that part though (they being my doctor and mother - yep, 30 year old man, had to have his mom come to his doctor because he can't advocate for himself like a little bitch).  

But even if that all wasn't the case? I'm planning to do it this weekend. I can't see how this will ever get better. I'm a lazy pussy who can't even bring himself to say hi to people he wants to get to know. How will I ever get anyone to date me, let alone ever fall in love with someone? The answer is I won't, unless I can get over that fear. But I never will, because I refuse to take risks to improve my situation. Even the most minor of risk is too much to handle. So I'll stay in my room, playing video games, looking at pictures of people in relationships, daydreaming of the life I'll never have, feeling sorry for myself instead of actually doing anything to fix it. Because I'm too scared of failure to ever try.

Death is a comforting thought and that’s why I’m so scared.,"No matter what we fear, whether if it is heights, needles, or escalators, fear has one thing at its core; humans are naturally afraid to die. The reason we feel pain and fear to begin with is because it is human nature to survive. However, if a person were to fall into a hole where it seems impossible to escape, somehow it’s comforting to know that death is an exit that will always be there. And that’s why I’m so damn scared. 

Maybe it’s my instincts reacting, telling me to survive no matter the cost. But I’ve been in this hole for far too long. I’ve tried over and over again to climb my way out, only to find myself falling and getting more hurt over and over again.

And there it is. Like a neon sign alluring my attention, there is an exit sign called death. Wouldn’t it be so easy to leave all this? And as often as I find myself grasping at death’s doorknob, I can’t seem to get myself to go through. Because every so often, daylight sneaks its way into my deep and otherwise dark hole. And as faint as it is, it somehow warms me inside. And I find my self staying here for another day, hoping that one day that daylight will outshine the exit sign that reads “death”.",No_Rooster_5489,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/tsla34/death_is_a_comforting_thought_and_thats_why_im_so/

Getting Help has Consequences. That is sickening.,"I'm suicidal.  I've made it clear to several mental health professionals that my time is limited by choice.  In 1.5 years the suicide clause in my insurance goes away.  They say the same shit every time: ""Go to the hospital if you're having an emergency.""  

I simply can't afford it.  To lose the money from an indefinite amount of hospital stay where people lie to me about how good life is is absurd.  This is the United States of America.  I fucking tried and failed.  It's been over for too long, if not from the beginning.  I would lose my job and have no support, losing my belongings and home as well.  With no social support from a family nor friend it's like I don't exist.  I wouldn't be missed if I wouldn't simply be.

My company give very little time off for anything.  In fact, it gives very little in general.  This is the US after all.  But I digress...

If I can't go to a hospital to get convinced that life is worth it, and therapists, psychiatrists, and social workers all fail to convince me as well, then are my options really just to blow out my brainstem or live in anguish?

Is it abusive to tell the person you have suicidal thoughts about that you are having suicidal thoughts?,"I don’t know what to do anymore I’ve talked to so many mental health professionals and people and nothing will ever change my mind.

Rambling,"Sorry if this is the wrong place for this. I hate that I've gotten to the point where I feel the need to write this on a public forum but whatever. To sum up all of my issues in a sentence I hate myself with a burning passion and I absolutely deserve it. As I am now, I'm completely worthless. Not good at anything, don't know what I want to do with myself, don't even know how to begin to work towards the one goal I do have. I really don't even know who the hell I am. In my 21 years of life, I've done absolutely nothing but waste time and now here I am completely stuck in a hole that I dug.

Everything that's happened to me, especially in the last year or so, has been 100% my fault. I'll go over a few of them. I got my first job last summer and got bullied by my coworkers because I was too much of a bitch to defend myself. I made so many stupid mistakes in that job and it bothers me so much when I think back on them. 21 years old and still being bullied and just like when I was younger, I let it happen. I officially got kicked out of college last semester because of my own stupidity and pride effectively tossing my whole future into the fucking dark.  I don't have a single accomplishment under my belt. I've done nothing, therefore I am nothing and I desperately want to be something. In my search for a way to climb out of this hole I'm in, I see a lot of people saying that I need to silence negative self-talk or at least replace it with positive self-talk but what if your negative self-talk is right? Because I feel that mine is. Am I worthless? Yes, I have nothing to offer to anyone. I've given no one, not even my family, any reason to be proud of me or even care that I'm alive. Am I a failure? Clearly. Am I a piece of shit? I legitimately cannot name a single redeeming quality that I have so I'd have to say yes I'm trash. Am I a bitch? I'm literally scared to post this or comment on any posts out of fear of looking stupid or being wrong. Replacing these thoughts with ""positive"" self-talk would equate to me lying to myself.

I want to believe that I'm worthy. I want to believe that I can overcome whatever the hell I'm dealing with. I mean I must at least kind of feel that way, right? Why else would I be writing this or trying to make changes in my life? I want to believe that I deserve to be forgiven for my past mistakes, but why though? Why do I deserve these things? What's so special about me that I ""deserve"" anything? Death looks more and more appealing with each passing day because shit looks bleak y'all. I've fucked this life *badly* and I don't know if I can fix it.  If I die, I don't have to deal with any of this. None of my past mistakes will matter anymore because I'll be too busy being dead to care. I won't have to watch literally everyone around me live their best lives while I sit here and struggle to get myself together. I won't have to think about my mom's disappointment in me. I just don't know man. I've rambled long enough I think so I'll stop. If you have any advice I'm all ears.
